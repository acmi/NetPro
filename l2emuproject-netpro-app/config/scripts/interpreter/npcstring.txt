85713	Whoa, wait a minute you. Who do you think you are, shoving a camera in my face without permission? I'm going to report you!
85714	No no, no pictures! I look horrible today!

85730	Aren't there any cute monsters to look at? These are really not aesthetically appealing…
85780	Ahh, how long since I last visited Fantasy Isle again?
85781	Mm, yes. The crowd, the noise, the junk food. The markers of a true festival!
85782	Oh hey, new attractions! I can't leave these things untested now, can I?
85783	New facilities are great and all, but nothing beats the good ol' Block Checkers or Kratei's Cube.

99715	Good luck!
99716	I'm all grown up now!
99717	If you let me go, I'll be your best friend.
99718	I'm chuck full of goodness!
99719	Good job! Now what are you going to do?
99720	Keep it coming!
99721	That's what I'm talking about!
99722	May I have some more?

99729	Nectar is sublime!
99730	You call that a hit?
99731	Why are you hitting me? Ouch, stop it! Give me nectar!
99732	Stop or I'll wilt!
99733	I'm not fully grown yet! Oh well, do what you will. I'll fade away without nectar anyway!
99734	Go ahead and hit me again. It won't do you any good!
99735	Woe is me! I'm wilting!
99736	I'm not fully grown yet! How about some nectar to ease my pain?
99737	The end is near!
99738	Pretty please... with sugar on top, give me some nectar!
99739	If I die without nectar, you'll get nothing.

99756	This is awful!
99757	I think I broke something!
99758	What a lovely melody! Play it again!
99759	Music to my, uh... ears!
99760	You need music lessons!
99761	I can't hear you!
99762	You can't hurt me like that!

99780	Better luck next time!
99781	Nice shot!
99782	I'm not afraid of you!
99783	If I knew this was going to happen, I would have stayed home!
99784	Try harder or I'm out of here!
99785	I'm tougher than I look!
99786	Good strike!
99787	Oh my gourd!
99788	That's all you've got?
99789	Why me?
99790	Bring me nectar!
99791	I must have nectar to grow!

99793	Please give me some nectar! I'm hungry!
99794	Nectar please!
99795	Nectar will make me grow quickly!
99796	Don't you want a bigger wintermelon? Give me some Nectar and I'll grow much larger!
99797	If you raise me well, you'll get prizes! Or not...
99798	You are here for the stuff, eh? Well it's mine, all mine!

1000016	Invader!
1000017	There is no reason for you to kill me! I have nothing you need!
1000018	Someday you will pay!
1000019	I won't just stand still while you hit me.
1000020	Stop hitting!
1000021	It hurts to the bone!
1000022	Am I the neighborhood drum for beating!
1000023	Follow me if you want!
1000024	Surrender!
1000025	Oh, I'm dead!
1000026	I'll be back!
1000027	I'll give you ten million arena if you let me live!
1000028	$s1. Stop kidding yourself about your own powerlessness!
1000029	$s1. I'll make you feel what true fear is!
1000030	You're really stupid to have challenged me. $s1! Get ready!
1000031	$s1. Do you think that's going to work?!
1000032	I will definitely reclaim my honor which has been tarnished!
1000033	Show me the wrath of the knight whose honor has been downtrodden!
1000034	Death to the hypocrite!
1000035	I'll never sleep until I've shed my dishonor!
1000036	I'm here for the ones that are cursing the world!
1000037	I'll turn you into a malignant spirit!
1000038	I'll curse you with the power of revenge and hate!
1000039	For the glory of Gracia!
1000040	Do you dare pit your power against me?
1000041	I... I am defeated!!!
1000042	I am conveying the will of Nurka! Everybody get out of my way!
1000043	Those who stand against me shall die horribly!
1000044	Do you dare to block my way?!
1000045	My comrades will get revenge!
1000046	You heathen blasphemers of this holy place will be punished!
1000047	Step forward, you worthless creatures who challenge my authority!
1000048	My creator... The unchanging faithfulness to my master...
1000049	Master of the tower... My master... master... Where is he?
1000050	I AM THE ONE CARRYING OUT THE WILL OF CORE.
1000051	DESTROY THE INVADER.
1000052	STRANGE CONDITION - DOESN'T WORK
1000053	According to the command of Beleth... I'm going to observe you guys!
1000054	You people make me sick! No sense of loyalty whatsoever!
1000055	A challenge against me is the same as a challenge against Beleth...
1000056	Beleth is always watching over you guys!
1000057	That was really close! Antharas opened its eyes!
1000058	You who disobey the will of Antharas! Die!
1000059	Antharas has taken my life!
1000060	I crossed back over the marshlands of death to reclaim the treasure!
1000061	Bring over and surrender your precious gold treasure to me!
1000062	I'll kill you in an instant!
1000063	No! The treasure is still..!
1000064	Invaders of Dragon Valley will never live to return!
1000065	I am the guardian that honors the command of Antharas to watch over this place!
1000066	You've set foot in Dragon Valley without permission! The penalty is death!
1000067	Antharas has taken my life!
1000068	The joy of killing! The ecstasy of looting! Hey guys, let's have a go at it again!
1000069	There really are still lots of folks in the world without fear! I'll teach you a lesson!
1000070	If you hand over everything you've got, I'll at least spare your life!
1000071	Kneel down before one such as this!
1000072	Honor the master's wishes and punish all the invaders!
1000073	Follow the master's wishes and punish the invaders!
1000074	Death is nothing more than a momentary rest...
1000075	Listen! This is the end of the human era! Antharas has awakened!
1000076	Present the lives of four people to Antharas!
1000077	This is unbelievable! How could I have lost to one so inferior to myself?
1000078	I carry the power of darkness and have returned from the abyss.
1000079	It's detestable.
1000080	I finally find rest...
1000081	Glory to Orfen!
1000082	In the name of Orfen, I can never forgive you who are invading this place!
1000083	I'll make you pay the price for fearlessly entering Orfen's land!
1000084	Even if you disappear into nothingness, you will still face the life-long suffering of the curse that I have given you.
1000085	I'll stand against anyone that makes light of the sacred place of the Elves!
1000086	I will kill with my own hands anyone that defiles our home!
1000087	My brothers will never rest until we push you and your gang out of this valley!
1000088	Until the day of destruction of Hestui!
1000089	If any intrepid Orcs remain, attack them!
1000090	I'll break your windpipe!
1000091	Is revenge a failure?!
1000092	The sparkling mithril of the dwarves and their pretty treasures! I'll get them all!
1000093	Where are all the dreadful dwarves and their sparkling things?
1000094	Hand over your pretty treasures!
1000095	Hey! You should have run away!
1000096	DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE! DESTRUCTION - EXTINCTION - SLAUGHTER - COLLAPSE!
1000097	Destruction! Destruction! Destruction! Destruction!
1000098	Destruction! Destruction! Destruction. . .
1000099	Ta-da! Uthanka has returned!
1000100	Wah, ha, ha, ha! Uthanka has taken over this island today!
1000101	Whew! He's quite a guy!
1000102	How exasperating and unfair to have things happen in such a meaningless way like this...
1000103	This world should be filled with fear and sadness...
1000104	I won't forgive the world that cursed me!
1000105	I'll make everyone feel the same suffering as me!
1000106	I'll give you a curse that you'll never be able to remove forever!
1000107	I'll get revenge on you who slaughtered my compatriots!
1000108	Those who are afraid should get away and those who are brave should fight!
1000109	I've got power from Beleth so do you think I'll be easily defeated?!
1000110	I am leaving now, but soon someone will come who will teach you all a lesson!
1000111	Hey guys, let's make a round of our territory!
1000112	The rumor is that there are wild, uncivilized ruffians who have recently arrived in my territory.
1000113	Do you know who I am?! I am Sirocco! Everyone, attack!
1000114	What's just happened?! The invincible Sirocco was defeated by someone like you?!
1000115	Oh, I'm really hungry...
1000116	I smell food. Ooh...
1000117	Ooh...
1000118	What does honey of this place taste like?!
1000119	Give me some sweet, delicious golden honey!
1000120	If you give me some honey, I'll at least spare your life...
1000121	Only for lack of honey did I lose to the likes of you.
1000122	Where is the traitor Kuroboros!?
1000123	Look in every nook and cranny around here!
1000124	Are you Lackey of Kuroboros?! I'll knock you out in one shot!
1000125	He just closed his eyes without disposing of the traitor... How unfair!
1000126	Hell for unbelievers in Kuroboros!
1000127	The person that does not believe in Kuroboros, his life will soon become hell!
1000128	The lackey of that demented devil, the servant of a false god! I'll send that fool straight to hell!
1000129	Uh... I'm not dying; I'm just disappearing for a moment... I'll resurrect again!
1000130	Hail to Kuroboros, the founder of our religion!
1000131	Only those who believe in Patriarch Kuroboros shall receive salvation!
1000132	Are you the ones that Sharuk has incited?! You also should trust in Kuroboros and be saved!
1000133	Kuroboros will punish you.
1000134	You who have beautiful spirits that shine brightly! I have returned!
1000135	You that are weary and exhausted... Entrust your souls to me.
1000136	The color of your soul is very attractive.
1000137	Those of you who live! Do you know how beautiful your souls are?!
1000138	It... will... kill... everyone...
1000139	I'm... so... lonely...
1000140	My... enemy...!
1000141	... Now... I'm not so lonely!
1000142	I will never forgive the Pixy Murika... that is trying to... kill us!
1000143	Attack all the dull and stupid followers of Murika!
1000144	I didn't have any idea about such ambitions!
1000145	This is not the end... It's just the beginning.
1000146	Hey... Shall we have some fun for the first time in a long while?...
1000147	There've been some things going around like crazy here recently...
1000148	Hey! Do you know who I am? I am Malex, Herald of Dagoniel! Attack!
1000149	What's just happened?! The invincible Malex just lost to the likes of you?!
1000150	It's something repeated in a vain life...
1000151	Shake in fear, all you who value your lives!
1000152	I'll make you feel suffering like a flame that is never extinguished!
1000153	Back to the dirt...
1000154	Hail Varika!!
1000155	Nobody can stop us!
1000156	You move slowly!
1000157	Varika! Go first!
1000158	Where am I? Who am I?
1000159	Uh... My head hurts like it's going to burst! Who am I?
1000160	You jerk. You're a devil! You're a devil to have made me like this!
1000161	Where am I? What happened? Thank you!

1000182	Behold the awesome power of magic!
1000183	Your powers are impressive but you must not annoy our high level sorcerer.
1000184	I am Barda, master of the Bandit Stronghold!
1000185	I, Master Barda, once owned that stronghold,
1000186	Ah, very interesting!
1000187	You are more powerful than you appear. We'll meet again!
1000188	You filthy sorcerers disgust me!
1000189	Why would you build a tower in our territory?
1000190	Are you part of that evil gang of sorcerers?
1000191	That is why I don't bother with anyone below the level of sorcerer.
1000192	Ah, another beautiful day!
1000193	Our specialties are arson and looting.
1000194	You will leave empty-handed!
1000195	Ah, so you admire my treasure, do you? Try finding it! Ha!
1000196	Is everybody listening? Sirion has come back. Everyone chant and bow...
1000197	Bow down, you worthless humans!
1000198	Very tacky!
1000199	Don't think that you are invincible just because you defeated me!
1000200	The material desires of mortals are ultimately meaningless.
1000201	Do not forget the reason the Tower of Insolence collapsed.
1000202	You humans are all alike, full of greed and avarice!
1000203	All for nothing,
1000204	What are all these people doing here?
1000205	I must find the secret of eternal life, here among these rotten angels!
1000206	Do you also seek the secret of immortality?
1000207	I shall never reveal my secrets!
1000208	Who dares enter this place?
1000209	This is no place for humans! You must leave immediately.
1000210	You poor creatures! Too stupid to realize your own ignorance!
1000211	You mustn't go there!
1000212	Who dares disturb this marsh?
1000213	The humans must not be allowed to destroy the marshland for their greedy purposes.
1000214	You are a brave man...
1000215	You idiots! Some day you shall also be gone!
1000216	Someone has entered the forest...
1000217	The forest is very quiet and peaceful.
1000218	Stay here in this wonderful forest!
1000219	My... my souls...
1000220	This forest is a dangerous place.
1000221	Unless you leave this forest immediately you are bound to run into serious trouble.
1000222	Leave now!
1000223	Why do you ignore my warning?
1000224	Harits of the world... I bring you peace!
1000225	Harits! Be courageous!
1000226	I shall eat your still-beating heart!.
1000227	Harits! Keep faith until the day I return... Never lose hope!
1000228	Even the giants are gone! There's nothing left to be afraid of now!
1000229	Have you heard of the giants? Their downfall was inevitable!
1000230	What nerve! Do you dare to challenge me?
1000231	You are as evil as the giants...
1000232	This dungeon is still in good condition!
1000233	This place is spectacular, wouldn't you say?
1000234	You are very brave warriors!
1000235	Are the giants truly gone for good?
1000236	These graves are good.
1000237	Gold and silver are meaningless to a dead man!
1000238	Why would those corrupt aristocrats bury such useful things?
1000239	You filthy pig! Eat and be merry now that you have shirked your responsibilities!
1000240	Those thugs! It would be too merciful to rip them apart and chew them up one at a time!
1000241	You accursed scoundrels!
1000242	Hmm, could this be the assassin sent by those idiots from Aden?
1000243	I shall curse your name with my last breath!
1000244	My beloved Lord Shilen.
1000245	I must break the seal and release Lord Shilen as soon as possible...
1000246	You shall taste the vengeance of Lord Shilen!
1000247	Lord Shilen... some day... you will accomplish... this mission...
1000248	Towards immortality...
1000249	He who desires immortality... Come unto me.
1000250	You shall be sacrificed to gain my immortality!
1000251	Eternal life in front of my eyes... I have collapsed in such a worthless way like this...
1000252	Zaken, you are a cowardly cur!
1000253	You are immortal, aren't you, Zaken?
1000254	Please return my body to me.
1000255	Finally... will I be able to rest?
1000256	What is all that racket?
1000257	Master Gildor does not like to be disturbed.
1000258	Please, just hold it down...
1000259	If you disturb Master Gildor I won't be able to help you.
1000260	Who dares approach?
1000261	These reeds are my territory...
1000262	You fools! Today you shall learn a lesson!
1000263	The past goes by... Is a new era beginning?...
1000264	This is the garden of Eva.
1000265	The garden of Eva is a sacred place.
1000266	Do you mean to insult Eva?
1000267	How rude!  Eva's love is available to all, even to an ill-mannered lout like yourself!
1000268	This place once belonged to Lord Shilen.
1000269	Leave this palace to us, spirits of Eva.
1000270	Why are you getting in our way?
1000271	Shilen... our Shilen!
1000272	All who fear of Fafurion... Leave this place at once!
1000273	You are being punished in the name of Fafurion!
1000274	Oh, master... please forgive your humble servant...
1000275	Prepare to die, foreign invaders! I am Gustav, the eternal ruler of this fortress and I have taken up my sword to repel thee!
1000276	Glory to Aden, the Kingdom of the Lion! Glory to Sir Gustav, our immortal lord!
1000277	Soldiers of Gustav, go forth and destroy the invaders!
1000278	This is unbelievable! Have I really been defeated? I shall return and take your head!
1000279	Could it be that I have reached my end? I cannot die without honor, without the permission of Sir Gustav!
1000280	Ah, the bitter taste of defeat... I fear my torments are not over...
1000281	I follow the will of Fafurion.

1029350	What took so long? I waited for ever.
1029351	I must ask Librarian Sophia about the book.
1029352	This library... It's huge but there aren't many useful books, right?
1029353	An underground library... I hate damp and smelly places...
1029354	The book that we seek is certainly here. Search inch by inch.
1029450	We must search high and low in every room for the reading desk that contains the book we seek.
1029451	Remember the content of the books that you found. You can't take them out with you.
1029452	It seems that you cannot remember to the room of the watcher who found the book.
1029453	Your work here is done, so return to the central guardian.
1029460	You foolish invaders who disturb the rest of Solina, be gone from this place.
1029461	I know not what you seek, but this truth cannot be handled by mere humans.
1029462	I will not stand by and watch your foolish actions. I warn you, leave this place at once.
1029550	The guardian of the seal doesn't seem to get injured at all until the barrier is destroyed.
1029551	The device located in the room in front of the guardian of the seal is definitely the barrier that controls the guardian's power.
1029552	To remove the barrier, you must find the relics that fit the barrier and activate the device.
1029553	All the guardians were defeated, and the seal was removed. Teleport to the center.
1030101	You've captured a Wisp successfully.
1032003	Wait...wait a minute! I still have time!

1032313	It's quite a walk to Ruins of Ye Sagira…
1032314	Isn't there an easier way to get there?

1032322	Watch out! You are being attacked!
1032323	You'll never leave with that book!.
1032324	Finally... I thought I was going to die waiting.
1032325	Your normal attacks aren't working!
1032326	Looks like only skill based attacks damage them!
1032327	Use your skill attacks against them!
1032328	Enough of this… come at me!

1032344	While training in the Training Grounds, it becomes progressively difficult.
1032345	Training Grounds access? You need to speak with Pantheon in the Museum.
1032346	Hey! Did you speak with Pantheon?

1620092	This is a hideout made with 'Shine Stone' used in Giant's Dimensional technique.  Supposedly the capital of the Giants that hasn't been found yet is still somewhere in the Dimensional Crack...
1620093	The Earth Wyrm has lost consciousness.
1620094	The Earth Wyrm stopped gathering energy.
1620095	The Earth Wyrm completed gathering energy.

1620099	Teredor is entering the Earth Wyrm.
1620100	Teredor has entered.
1620101	It is the selected time!
1622001	There's a noble king who did not fall before the hammer of old gods
1622002	All the giants trusted their lives on that courage.
1622003	Saving the lives with beautiful lady Belis, Slashing the Gods
1622004	Even the five dragons of darkness swallowed the flames in reverence
1622005	Sword rusts and magic is forgotten
1622006	Lady goes under the veil and the king falls on the dust
1622007	Who remembers the halls of Harnak and powers of platinum

1622015	I'm going to back off for a bit!
1622016	Only death awaits for the weak!
1622017	I will attack the enemy's healer!
1622018	Blink attack!
1622019	Switch to fast shooting mode
1622020	Switch to fast casting mode
1622021	When the song of giant is finished, Ghost of Harnak appeared.
1622022	When the Knights of Seal fall, Harnak gets stronger.
1622023	Knight of seal falls. Harnak, who absorbs the powers and skills of the knight, becomes stronger.
1622024	Ghost of Harnak has appeared.
1622201	All seals have been broken. Ghost of Harnak will appear soon
1622202	All jails are open. Ghost of Harnak will appear soon

1717810	Lord Triol, please let us hear your voice again!
1717811	We must find creatures to sacrifice to Lord Triol.
1717812	Is this where I can find creatures to sacrifice for Lord Triol?
1717813	Found you! Consider it an honor to be offered up to Lord Triol.
1717814	So weak-looking… must be easy to snatch away.
1717815	Where did they go? Hmm… we'll withdraw for now. Can't find anything to serve as offerings here.
1717816	I heard this is where I could find them… I guess I'll have to look elsewhere.

1800023	It's a weapon surrounded by an ominous aura. I'll discard it because it may be dangerous. Miss...!
1800024	Thank you for saving me from the clutches of evil!
1800025	That is it for today...let's retreat. Everyone pull back!
1800026	Thank you for the rescue. It's a small gift.

1800031	An alarm has been set off! Everybody will be in danger if they are not taken care of immediately!
1800032	It will not be that easy to kill me!
1800033	No...You knew my weakness...
1800034	Hello? Is anyone there?
1800035	Is no one there? How long have I been hiding? I have been starving for days and cannot hold out anymore!
1800036	If someone would give me some of those tasty Crystal Fragments, I would gladly tell them where Tears is hiding! Yummy, yummy!
1800037	Hey! You from above the ground! Let's share some Crystal Fragments, if you have any.
1800038	Crispy and cold feeling! Teehee! Delicious!!
1800039	Yummy! This is so tasty.
1800040	Sniff, sniff! Give me more Crystal Fragments!
1800041	How insensitive! It's not nice to give me just a piece! Can't you give me more?
1800042	Ah - I'm hungry!
1800043	I'm the real one!
1800044	Pick me!
1800045	Trust me!

1800051	I'm the real one! Phew!!
1800052	Can't you even find out?
1800053	Find me!
1800054	Huh?! How did you know it was me?
1800055	Excellent choice! Teehee!
1800056	You've done well!
1800057	Oh... very sensible?
1800058	Behold the mighty power of Baylor, foolish mortal!
1800059	No one is going to survive!
1800060	You'll see what hell is like...
1800061	You will be put in jail!
1800062	Worthless creature... Go to hell!
1800063	I'll give you something that you'll never forget!
1800064	Why did you trust to choose me? Hahahaha....
1800065	I'll make you regret that you ever chose me...
1800066	Don't expect to get out alive..
1800067	Demon King Beleth, give me the power! Aaahh!!!
1800068	No....... I feel the power of Fafurion.......
1800069	Fafurion! Please give power to this helpless witch!!
1800070	I can't help you much, but I can weaken the power of Baylor since I'm locked up here.
1800071	Your skill is impressive. I'll admit that you are good enough to pass. Take the key and leave this place.
1800072	Give me all you have! It's the only way I'll let you live!!
1800073	Hun.. hungry
1800074	Don't be lazy! You bastards!
1800075	They are just henchmen of the Iron Castle... Why did we hide?
1800076	Guys, show them our power!!!!
1800077	You have finally come here. But you will not be able to find the secret room!
1800078	You have done well in finding me, but I cannot just hand you the key!
1800079	$s1 second(s) remaining.
1800080	Match begins in $s1 minute(s). Please gather around the administrator.

1800109	Enemy invasion! Hurry up!
1800110	Process... shouldn't... be delayed... because of me...
1800111	Alright, now Leodas is yours!

1800113	Time rift device activation successful!
1800114	Freedom or death!!!
1800115	This is the will of true warriors!!!

1800170	This is... This is a great achievement that is worthy of the true heroes of legend!
1800171	Admirable. You greatly decreased the speed of invasion through Kamaloka.
1800172	Very good. Your skill makes you a model for other adventurers to follow.
1800173	Good work. If all adventurers produce results like you, we will slowly start to see the glimmer of hope.
1800174	Unfortunately, it seems that Rim Kamaloka cannot be easily approached by everyone.
1800175	How disappointing. It looks like I made a mistake in sending you inside Rim Kamaloka.
1800176	Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
1800177	What are you doing? Hurry up and help me!
1800178	I've had it up to here with you! I'll take care of you!
1800179	Ah... My mind is a wreck.
1800180	If you thought that my subordinates would be so few, you are mistaken!
1800181	There's not much I can do, but I want to help you.
1800182	You $s1! Attack them!
1800183	Come out! My subordinate! I summon you to drive them out!
1800184	There's not much I can do, but I will risk my life to help you!
1800185	Arg! The pain is more than I can stand!
1800186	Ahh! How did he find my weakness?
1800187	We were able to successfully collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.
1800188	But we were able to collect somehow the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated. Here they are.
1800189	I'm sorry, but we were unable to collect the Essence of Kamaloka from the Kanabions that you defeated because their dark energy was too weak.
1800190	Rather than simply defeating the enemies, you seem to understand our goal and purpose as well.
1800191	Dopplers and Voids possess an enhanced amount of the Kanabions' dark energy, so it is important to concentrate on defeating them when blocking the Kamalokians attack.
1800192	Have you seen Kanabions being remade as new Kanabions sometimes? You can see it occur more often by inflicting great damage during an attack or at the moment you defeat them.
1800193	As in any other battle, it is critical to protect yourself while you are inside Rim Kamaloka. We do not want to attack recklessly.
1800194	We value developing an individual's overall power rather than a one-time victory. If you relied on another person's support this time, why don't you try to rely on your own strength next time?
1800195	Are you sure that the battle just now was at the appropriate level? Bothering lower Kanabions, as if for mere entertainment, is considered to be a wasted battle for us.
1800196	The greatest victory involves using all available resources, eliminating all of the enemy's opportunities, and bringing it to the fastest possible end. Don't you think so?
1800197	Emergency! Emergency! The outer wall is weakening rapidly!
1800198	The remaining strength of the outer wall is $s1!
1800199	Pathfinder Savior
1800200	Pathfinder Supporter
1800201	Some Kanabions who haven't fully adjusted yet to their new physical form are known to exhibit symptoms of an extremely weakened body structure sometimes. If you attack them at that moment, you will have great results.
1800202	Have you ever heard of $s1? They say it's a genuine $s2!
1800203	There are 5 minutes remaining to register for Kratei's cube match.

1800223	The regularly scheduled airship that flies to the Gracia continent has departed.
1800224	Another airship has been summoned to the wharf. Please try again later.
1800225	Huh? The sky looks funny. What's that?
1800226	A powerful subordinate is being held by the Barrier Orb! This reaction means...!
1800227	Be careful...! Something's coming...!
1800228	You must first found a clan or belong to one.
1800229	There is no party currently challenging Ekimus. \n If no party enters within $s1 seconds, the attack on the Heart of Infinity will fail...
1800230	Ekimus has gained strength from a tumor...
1800231	Ekimus has been weakened by losing strength from a tumor!
1800232	The Soul Coffin has awakened Ekimus. If $s1 more Soul Coffin(s) are created, the defense of the Heart of Infinity will fail...
1800233	C'mon, c'mon! Show your face, you little rats! Let me see what the doomed weaklings are scheming!
1800234	Impressive.... Hahaha it's so much fun, but I need to chill a little while.  Argekunte, clear the way!
1800235	Kyahaha! Since the tumor has been resurrected, I no longer need to waste my time on you!

1800906	Enter the watermelon~! It's gonna grow and grow from now on!
1800907	Oh, ouch~! Did I see you before~?
1800908	A new season! Summer is all about the watermelon~!
1800909	Did ya call~? Ho! Thought you'd get something~?^^
1800910	Do you want to see my beautiful self~?
1800911	Hohoho! Let's do it together~!
1800912	It's a giant watermelon if you raise it right~ And a watermelon slice if you mess up~!
1800913	Tada~ Transformation~ complete~!
1800914	Am I a rain watermelon? Or a defective watermelon?
1800915	Now! I've gotten big~! Everyone, come at me!
1800916	Get bigger~ Get stronger~! Tell me your wish~~!
1800917	A watermelon slice's wish! But I'm bigger already?
1800918	A large watermelon's wish! Well, try to break me!
1800919	I'm done growing~! I'm running away now~^^
1800920	If you let me go, I'll give you ten million Adena!
1800921	Freedom~! What do you think I have inside?
1800922	OK~ OK~ Good job. You know what to do next, right?
1800923	Look here! Do it right! You spilled! This precious...
1800924	Ah~ Refreshing! Spray a little more~!
1800925	Gulp gulp~ Great! But isn't there more?
1800926	Can't you even aim right? Have you even been to the army?
1800927	Did you mix this with water~? Why's it taste like this~!
1800928	Oh! Good! Do a little more. Yeah~
1800929	Hoho! It's not there! Over here~! Am I so small that you can even spray me right?
1800930	Yuck! What is this~! Are you sure this is nectar~?
1800931	Do your best~! I become a big watermelon after just five bottles~!
1800932	Of course~! Watermelon is the best nectar! Hahaha~!
1800933	Ahh! Good~ >_< Slap slap me~
1800934	Oww! You're just beating me now~ Give me nectar~
1800935	Look~!! It's gonna break~!
1800936	Now! Are you trying to eat without doing the work? Fine~ Do what you want~ I'll hate you if you don't give me any nectar!
1800937	Hit me more! Hit me more!
1800938	I'm gonna wither like this~ Damn it~!
1800939	Hey you~ If I die like this, there'll be no item either~ Are you really so stingy with the nectar?
1800940	It's just a little more!! Good luck~!
1800941	Save me~ I'm about to die without tasting nectar even once~
1800942	If I die like this, I'll just be a watermelon slice~!
1800943	I'm getting stronger~? I think I'll be able to run away in 30 seconds~ Hoho~
1800944	It's goodbye after 20 seconds~!
1800945	Yeah, 10 seconds left~! 9... 8... 7...!
1800946	I'm leaving in 2 minutes if you don't give me any nectar~!
1800947	I'm leaving in 1 minutes if you don't give me any nectar~!
1800948	I'm leaving now~! Then, goodbye~!
1800949	Sorry, but this large watermelon is disappearing here~!
1800950	Too late~! Have a good time~!
1800951	Ding ding~ That's the bell. Put away your weapons and try for next time~!
1800952	Too bad~! You raised it up, too! -_-
1800953	Oh~ What a nice sound~
1800954	The instrument is nice, but there's no song. Shall I sing for you?
1800955	What beautiful music!
1800956	I feel good~ Play some more!
1800957	My heart is being captured by the sound of Crono!
1800958	Get the notes right~! Hey old man~ That was wrong!
1800959	I like it~!
1800960	Ooh~~ My body wants to open!
1800961	Oh~! This chord! My heart is being torn! Play a little more!
1800962	It's this~ This! I wanted this sound! Why don't you try becoming a singer?
1800963	You can try a hundred times on this~ You won't get anything good~!
1800964	It hurts~! Play just the instrument~!
1800965	Only good music can open my body!
1800966	Not this, but you know, that~ What you got as a Chronicle souvenir. Play with that!
1800967	Why~ You have no music? Boring... I'm leaving now~
1800968	Not those sharp things~! Use the ones that make nice sounds!
1800969	Large watermelons only open with music~ Just striking with a weapon won't work~!
1800970	Strike with music~! Not with something like this. You need music~!
1800971	You're pretty amazing~! But it's all for nothing~~!
1800972	Use that on monsters, OK? I want Crono~!
1800973	Everyone~ The watermelon is breaking!!!
1800974	It's like a watermelon slice~!
1800975	A goblin is coming out(?)!
1800976	Large watermelon~! Make a wish!!
1800977	Don't tell anyone about my death~
1800978	Ugh~ The red juice is flowing out!
1800979	This is all~
1800980	Kyaahh!!! I'm mad...!
1800981	Everyone~ This watermelon broke open!! The item is falling out!
1800982	Oh! It burst! The contents are spilling out~
1800983	Hohoho~ Play better!
1800984	Oh~!! You're very talented, huh~?
1800985	Play some more! More!  More!  More!
1800986	I eat hits and grow!!
1800987	Buck up~ There isn't much time~
1800988	Do you think I'll burst with just that~?
1800989	What a nice attack~ You might be able to kill a passing fly~
1800990	Right there! A little to the right~! Ah~ Refreshing.
1800991	You call that hitting? Bring some more talented friends!
1800992	Don't think! Just hit! We're hitting!
1800993	I need nectar~ Gourd nectar!
1800994	I can only grow by drinking nectar~
1800995	Grow me quick! If you're good, it's a large watermelon. If you're bad, it a watermelon slice~!
1800996	Gimme nectar~ I'm hungry~
1800997	Hurry and bring me nectar... Not a necktie~... (sorry)
1800998	Bring me nectar. Then, I'll drink and grow!
1800999	You wanna eat a tiny watermelon like me? Try giving me some nectar. I'll get huge~!
1801000	Hehehe... Grow me well and you'll get a reward. Grow me bad and who knows what'll happen~
1801001	You want a large watermelon? I'd like to be a watermelon slice~
1801002	Trust me and bring me some nectar!! I'll become a large watermelon for you~!
1801003	I see. Beleth has recovered all of its magic power. What remains here is just its trace.
1801004	Command Channel Leader $s1, Beleth' Ring has been acquired.
1801005	You summoned me, so you must be confident, huh? Here I come! Jack game!
1801006	Hello. Let's have a good Jack game.
1801007	I'm starting! Now, show me the card you want!
1801008	We'll start now! Show me the card you want!
1801009	I'm showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1801010	I'll be showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1801011	I'm showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1801012	I'll be showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1801013	That's my precious Fantastic Chocolate Banana Ultra Favor Candy!!! I'm definitely winning the next round!!
1801014	It's my precious candy, but... I'll happily give it to you~!
1801015	The candy fell. I'll give you my toy chest instead.
1801016	Since the candy fell, I will give you my toy chest instead.
1801017	You're not peeking at my card, are you? This time, I'll wager a special scroll.
1801018	We're getting serious now. If you win again, I'll give you a special scroll.
1801019	You could probably enter the underworld pro league!
1801020	Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.
1801021	Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.
1801022	I lost again. I won't lose this time. I'm betting my Transformation Stick.
1801023	Lost again! Hmph. Next time, I'll bet an incredible gift! Wait for it if you want!
1801024	You're too good. Next time, I'll give you an incredible gift! Please wait for you.
1801025	My pride can't handle you winning anymore!
1801026	I would be embarrassing to lose again here...
1801027	What's your name? I'm gonna remember you!
1801028	People from the above ground world are really good at games.
1801029	You've played a lot in the underworld, haven't you?!
1801030	I've never met someone so good before.
1801031	13 wins in a row. You're pretty lucky today, huh?
1801032	I never thought I would see 13 wins in a row.
1801033	This is the best record I've seen! Next time I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!
1801034	Even pros can't do 14 wins...! Next time I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!
1801035	I can't do this anymore! You win! I acknowledge you as the best I've ever met in all my 583 years!
1801036	Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.
1801037	I won this round...! It was fun.
1801038	I won this round. It was enjoyable.
1801039	Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!
1801040	Call me again next time. I want to play again with you.
1801041	You wanna play some more? I'm out of presents, but I'll give you candy!
1801042	Will you play some more? I don't have any more presents, but I will give you candy if you win.
1801043	You're the best. Out of all the Jack's game players I've ever met... I give up!
1801044	Wowww. Awesome. Really. I have never met someone as good as you before. Now... I can't play anymore.
1801045	$s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.
1801046	Congratulations! $s1 has won $s2 Jack's games in a row.
1801047	Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game!
1801048	Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on winning 1st place in Jack's game... If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!
1801049	Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...
1801050	Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...
1801051	You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1801052	You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1801053	If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!
1801054	You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~
1801055	Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.
1801056	Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~
1801057	Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.
1801058	Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.
1801059	You showed the same card as me, so you win.
1801060	You showed a different card from me, so you lose.
1801061	That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~
1801062	It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.
1801063	You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!
1801064	The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.
1801065	You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~
1801066	You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~
1801067	Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!
1801068	Hahahaha!
1801069	Where are you looking?
1801070	I'm right here.
1801071	Annoying concentration attacks are disrupting Valakas' concentration!\nIf it continues, you may get a great opportunity!
1801072	Some warrior's blow has left a huge gash between the great scales of Valakas!\nValakas' P. Def. is greatly decreased!
1801073	Annoying concentration attacks overwhelmed Valakas, making it forget its rage and become distracted!
1801074	Long-range concentration attacks have enraged Valakas!\nIf you continue, it may become a dangerous situation!
1801075	Because the cowardly counterattacks continued, Valakas' fury has reached its maximum!\nValakas' P. Atk. is greatly increased!
1801076	Valakas has been enraged by the long-range concentration attacks and is coming toward its target with even greater zeal!
1801077	Listen, oh Tantas! I have returned! The Prophet Yugoros of the Black Abyss is with me, so do not be afraid!
1801078	Welcome, $s1! Let us see if you have brought a worthy offering for the Black Abyss!
1801079	What a formidable foe! But I have the Abyss Weed given to me by the Black Abyss! Let me see...
1801080	Muhahaha! Ah, this burning sensation in my mouth! The power of the Black Abyss is reviving me!
1801081	No! How dare you stop me from using the Abyss Weed... Do you know what you have done?!
1801082	A limp creature like this is unworthy to be an offering... You have no right to sacrifice to the Black Abyss!
1801083	Listen, oh Tantas! The Black Abyss is famished! Find some fresh offerings!
1801084	Ah... How could I lose... Oh, Black Abyss, receive me...
1801085	Alarm system destroyed. Intruder excluded.

1801091	The beast ate the feed, but it isn't showing a response, perhaps because it's already full.
1801092	The beast spit out the feed instead of eating it.
1801093	The beast spit out the feed and is instead attacking you!
1801094	$s1 is leaving you because you don't have enough Golden Spices.
1801095	$s1 is leaving you because you don't have enough Crystal Spices.
1801096	$s1. May the protection of the gods be upon you!
1801097	Freya has started to move.
1801098	How could I... fall... in a place like this...
1801099	I can finally take a breather. By the way, who are you? Hmm... I think I know who sent you.
1801100	$s1 of Balance

1801110	Battle end limit time
1801111	Strong magic power can be felt from somewhere!!
1801112	How dare you attack my recruits!!
1801113	Who is disrupting the order?!
1801114	The drillmaster is dead!
1801115	Line up the ranks!!
1801116	I brought the food.
1801117	Come and eat.
1801118	Looks delicious.
1801119	Let's go eat.
1801120	Archer. Give your breath for the intruder!
1801121	My knights. Show your loyalty!!
1801122	I can take it no longer!!!
1801123	Archer. Heed my call!
1801124	The space feels like its gradually starting to shake.
1801125	I can no longer stand by.
1801126	Taklacan is gathering its strength and launching an attack.
1801127	Taklacan received Kokracon and became weaker.
1801128	Kokracon's power can be felt nearby.
1801129	Taklacan is preparing to hide itself.
1801130	Taklacan disappears into the space of futility with a roar.
1801131	Torumba's body is starting to move.
1801132	A response can be felt from Torumba's tough skin.
1801133	A mark remains on Torumba's tough skin.
1801134	The light is beginning to weaken in Torumba's eyes.
1801135	Torumba's left leg was damaged.
1801136	Torumba's right leg was damaged.
1801137	Torumba's left arm was damaged.
1801138	Torumba's right arm was damaged.
1801139	A deep wound appeared on Torumba's tough skin.
1801140	The light is slowly fading from Torumba's eyes.
1801141	Torumba is preparing to hide its body.
1801142	Torumba disappeared into his space.
1801143	Torumba is preparing to hide itself in the twisted space.
1801144	Dopagen has started to move.
1801145	Leptilikon's energy feels like it's being condensed.
1801146	Dopagen is preparing to hide itself with a strange scent.
1801147	Dopagen is preparing to hide itself.
1801148	Dopagen is disappearing in between the twisted space.
1801149	Maguen appearance!!!
1801150	Enough Maguen Plasma - Bistakon have gathered.
1801151	Enough Maguen Plasma - Kokracon have gathered.
1801152	Enough Maguen Plasma - Leptilikon have gathered.
1801153	The plasmas have filled the aeroscope and are harmonized.
1801154	The plasmas have filled the aeroscope but they are ramming into each other, exploding, and dying.
1801155	Amazing. $s1 took 100 of these soul stone fragments. What a complete swindler.
1801156	Hmm? Hey, did you give $s1 something? But it was just 1. Haha.
1801157	$s1 pulled one with $s2 digits. Lucky~ Not bad~
1801158	It's better than losing it all, right? Or does this feel worse?
1801159	Ahem~!  $s1 has no luck at all. Try praying.
1801160	Ah... It's over. What kind of guy is that? Damn... Fine, you $s1, take it and get outta here.
1801161	A big piece is made up of little pieces. So here's a little piece~
1801162	You don't feel bad, right? Are you sad? But don't cry~
1801163	OK~ Who's next? It all depends on your fate and luck, right? At least come and take a look.
1801164	No one else? Don't worry~ I don't bite. Haha~!
1801165	There was someone who won 10,000 from me. A warrior shouldn't just be good at fighting, right? You've gotta be good in everything.
1801166	OK~ Master of luck? That's you? Haha~! Well, anyone can come after all.
1801167	Shedding blood is a given on the battleground. At least it's safe here.
1801168	Gasp!
1801169	Is it still long off?
1801170	Is Ermian well? Even I can't believe that I survived in a place like this...
1801171	I don't know how long it's been since I parted company with you... Time doesn't seem to move... It just feels too long...
1801172	Sorry to say this, but... The place you struck me before now hurts greatly...
1801173	Ugh... I'm sorry... It looks like this is it for me... I wanted to live and see my family...
1801174	Where are you? I can't see anything.
1801175	Where are you, really? I can't follow you like this.
1801176	I'm sorry... This is it for me.
1801177	Sob~ To see Ermian again... Can I go to my family now?
1801178	What's this feeling? Oh oh~! Feels like my energy is back~!
1801179	I feel so light! This is it! I know this feeling!
1801180	Wow~ My fatigue is completely gone!
1801181	Hey~ that ominous feeling has disappeared!
1801182	My body feels as light as a feather~
1801183	My energy was recovered so quickly. Thanks, $s1 -
1801184	How refreshing! You wouldn't happen to be a master masseuse, $s1, would you?
1801185	Incredible. From now on, I'll compare all massages to this one with $s1!
1801186	That's what I call a Cure-All!
1801187	I'm starving! I'll go find some meat.
1801188	Thank you, thank you!
1801189	Magic power so strong that it could make you lose your mind can be felt from somewhere!!
1801190	Even though you bring something called a gift among your humans, it would just be problematic for me...
1801191	I just don't know what expression I should have it appeared on me. Are human's emotions like this feeling?
1801192	The feeling of thanks is just too much distant memory for me...
1801193	But I kind of miss it... Like I had felt this feeling before...
1801194	I am Ice Queen Freya... This feeling and emotion are nothing but a part of Maliss'a memories.
1801195	Dear $s1... Think of this as my appreciation for the gift. Take this with you. There's nothing strange about it. It's just a bit of my capriciousness...
1801196	The kindness of somebody is not a bad feeling... Dear $s1, I will take this gift out of respect your kindness.

1801235	Hahaha... You dare to disrupt me... I will be your nightmare from which you can never awaken!
1801236	You dare attack me? I will fill your nightmares with blood!
1801237	I cannot let you stop the wraith of Shilen!
1801238	Ah…
1801239	Halt! Your nightmares will fill you with dread!
1801240	You won't get away!
1801241	How... All that power... Removed...
1801242	Shilen... I have failed...
1801243	To think that I could fail… impossible.
1801244	Who dares to bother us?
1801245	How foolish. The price of attacking me is death!
1801246	My sword will take your life!
1801247	Yaaah...
1801248	Prepare! I shall grant you death!
1801249	Oh, Shilen... Give me strength...
1801250	I would defeated...
1801251	Don't think this is the end!
1801252	No... I lost all the gathered power of light to this... this...
1801253	Are you the one to shatter the peace?
1801254	Our mission is to resurrect the goddess. Do not interfere.
1801255	I will let you sleep in darkness. Forever...
1801256	Hyaaaaaah....
1801257	Feel the true terror of darkness!
1801258	Oh, creatures of the goddess! Lend me your strength...
1801259	No! N... no! No!
1801260	I will always watch you from the darkness...
1801261	I mustn't lose the strength...
1801262	Hehehe, I'm glad you came. I was bored!
1801263	Hehehe, I'm glad you came. I was hungry!
1801264	Hehehe, shall we play?
1801265	Kyaaah...
1801266	Small fry! I will show you true madness!‎ Hahaha!!\
1801267	Hehehe! Prepare! My madness will swallow you up!
1801268	Huh? What happened...? I... I lost?
1801269	Huhuhu... Huhuhu... Huhahaha!
1801270	Ack! No! My body... It's disappearing...
1801271	Die...
1801272	Do not interfere...
1801273	For the goddess...
1801274	Ooooh...
1801275	You will die.
1801276	You will be destroyed.
1801277	Is this the end...?
1801278	Oh, goddess...
1801279	No! I didn't stay silent all this time, just to disappear now like this!
1801280	No! I don't want to die!
1801281	Yaaaahhh
1801282	This is crazy! I have to get out of here!
1801283	I will protect my family. C'mon!
1801284	I won't forgive you for attacking my child!
1801285	Don't bother my wife!
1801286	Don't bother my kids!
1801287	My husband is the pillar of our family!
1801288	My child is my treasure. How dare you hit him!
1801289	Save me~
1801290	Mom, Dad... Help~
1801291	Waah. Stop hitting~
1801292	No! Stop!
1801293	I've never seen this before...
1801294	I had a feeling that something like this would happen. But no one listened to me.
1801295	Stop!
1801296	How dare you enter here!
1801297	Do not think that you will avoid bloodshed by leaving here on your own free will. Your life is already forfeit!
1801300	You filthy monsters. I will take you on.
1801301	Stop right there. I will be your opponent.
1801302	I will show you the justice of Aden.
1801303	It's not over.
1801304	Stop there.
1801305	Waaaaaaaahhhhhh
1801306	Die!
1801307	Turn to ashes.
1801308	Multiple goals, shooting complete
1801309	Goal discovered nearby. Begin shooting.
1801310	Aim for goal. Shooting complete.
1801311	Withdraw.
1801312	Disappear.
1801313	Spirits, show yourselves.
1801314	Power of light. Protect us.
1801315	Come forth, Tree of Life!
1801316	MEN focus! Charging complete!
1801317	Save me! I can't move!
1801318	For us to live, you have to treat me until this altar comes to a stop.
1801319	Ack! No...
1801320	I am safe, thanks to you. I will begin supporting as soon as preparations are complete.
1801321	Vanguard of Aden! We have returned.
1801322	Defeat all the monsters!
1801323	You can no longer live here. Have a taste of the dimensional poison.
1801324	 Not bad for a bunch of humans. I'm leaving!
1801325	The ritual is complete. Now, I will show you hell.
1801326	You puny insects don't know your place. You cannot stop me.
1801327	No... How could this be... I can't go back to Nihil like this...
1801328	Kyeeeek. Kyaaaah.
1801329	Preparation
1801330	$s1 seconds to go!
1801331	Start!
1801332	Victory?! Victory?! Please come back after more honing.
1801333	Huh? That tickles... Is that the best you can do?
1801334	Huh? That kinda hurts. I don't like it~!
1801335	Gasp... How could I fall in just $s1 seconds...?!
1801336	My strength explodes with my sword dance!!!
1801337	My strength is multiplying!! Hahaha!!!
1801338	Forget about getting out of here alive...!
1801339	You hit me? Go ahead, try again!
1801340	The Guillotine is full of power. It's shooting out.
1801341	Now... Feel my invincibility...
1801342	I have decided to settle in this fortress. So get out of here!
1801343	Look around... Do you think you can defeat all of them?
1801344	Even if the fires of hell surround me...!
1801345	I will feed your corpses to the Mandragoras.
1801346	Stop your breathing! You have the stench of the living.
1801347	Guillotine! These humans dare to attack you.
1801348	I curse those whom I have killed!
1801349	Kyahahaha, stop making me laugh! That tickles!
1801350	Stop! That's enough.
1801351	I can't move...
1801352	Ooooh...
1801353	Argh!!
1801354	This can't be...!
1801355	Curses!
1801356	So, there are those who dare to challenge this sharp blade...
1801357	Ergh... I will bring you to the brink of death!
1801358	Now, you won't feel pain or suffering anymore...!
1801359	My whole body was born away, and I drowned in suffering...
1801360	Now, it is your turn to taste my suffering!
1801361	Kekeke... I have become accustomed to this pain.
1801362	Those who hear my screams will understand my pain...
1801363	Do not come any closer! The nightmare of death is coming!
1801364	Depart from me! Stop causing me pain...
1801365	Each day is painful. This body...
1801366	I was falsely accused... And I lost my eyes to torture...
1801367	My broken body can no longer hold a sword...
1801368	I survive on these things that surround my body.
1801369	Why?! If I had known the reason, I wouldn't have died with such regret.
1801370	I was a talented knighthood. But look at me now...
1801371	I must live in this body. It is unfair...
1801372	I was torn apart without a reason. I despised everything.
1801373	I will never forgive them! Never!
1801374	I want to rest for eternity... Who bothers me now?
1801375	You should be careful. You might die!
1801376	Hohoho... Do I look pitiful? That makes my anger rise.
1801377	Cry! Cry out!
1801378	See my appearance and suffer...
1801379	Sever!!!
1801380	I will punish everyone who turned me into this!
1801381	Stop tormenting me.
1801382	Ah ah ah uh uh...!
1801383	Keuk!
1801384	The suffering ends...!
1801385	I shall curse you from the grave.
1801386	Kyaaaaaaaahhhhh!
1801387	Sh! Sh! Shhhhhhh! Sssss....
1801388	K.. k.. kkkkk....!
1801389	Hakum! Daigan-dalaolsum!
1801390	Kkk... Kyaahh!
1801391	Bombomsara-bombomupsalla!
1801392	Sarasara bujarasarasara!!
1801393	Bukijika bukaja
1801394	Peeuuuukkkk!
1801395	Ack!
1801396	Taaak tak!
1801397	Oooo Oooo...
1801398	Hyak!
1801399	Heuooo...
1801400	Kh ah ah ah!
1801401	Keeuuuuhhhh!!
1801402	Keu... ooo...
1801403	Kaaahhh!
1801404	Krrrr...!!
1801405	Kuuuuu
1801406	Urggghh....!
1801407	If you wish to entrust your body to the guillotine, then come on!
1801408	Do you want the puppet experience?
1801409	Hazkal, I will accept the orders of the Guillotine and remove these purities.
1801410	I will offer them as a sacrifice to the guillotine.
1801411	Those who enter the fortress without permission have nothing to say!
1801412	I can hear a scream.
1801413	What a strange weapon. It's all shiny and cute.
1801414	I will destroy you one by one.
1801415	Submit to me, the faithful right-hand man.
1801416	Lose hope! Despair! Then, die!
1801417	Yes, it's this feeling! The feeling of striking you down!
1801418	You shall wither and die beneath the great guillotine fortress!
1801419	Your blood shall fill this fortress.
1801420	Kahahaha kyahahaha!
1801421	That tickles!
1801422	Oh guillotine! Great guillotine! See them!!
1801423	I'm warning you! Stop right here.
1801424	I am eternal! I am Hazkal, the closets being to the end of all things!
1801425	I don't want to die! I don't want to die for the second time!
1801426	Save me...
1801427	I still have a lot of souls to eat!
1801428	Gasp!
1801429	Urgh!
1801430	Oh guillotine, invaders have entered.
1801431	The darkness will swallow you up.
1801432	Binding, and the esthetics of tossing out
1801433	Blocking, and the power of force
1801434	Gasp
1801435	Keuk!
1801436	Urgh...!
1801437	Ooh...
1801438	You! The one hiding there!
1801439	My bowstring never rests.
1801440	I protect the guillotine fortress. Challenge me.
1801441	I will pierce you without end!
1801442	Fight fairly!
1801443	I shall have to report to Houpon.
1801444	I shall pierce your heart.
1801445	I will give you rest with the arrow of despair.
1801446	Do not take lightly the archers of the guillotine fortress!
1801447	You have to give me time to set up! I'm losing my mind.
1801448	Focused attack!
1801449	Ack!
1801450	Ooo... ooo...
1801451	I surrender! I surrender!
1801452	Houpon! I must call Houpon.
1801453	Houpon! Please avenge me.
1801454	I must report to Houpon.
1801455	Suffering... Lost... Forgetting...
1801456	Eternal life... Absorb... Resurrection...
1801457	Prophecy...
1801458	Slaughter... Contempt...
1801459	Future... Choice...
1801460	Death...
1801461	Beheading...
1801462	It's no fun if you die in one blow, right?
1801463	My sharp blade is thirsty for your blood...
1801464	Do not interfere. Are you using violence inside the fortress?!
1801465	There are mountains of corpses of those who attacked me without taking me seriously...
1801466	I will slash your flesh with this rune sword!
1801467	Huhuhu... What curious people you are.
1801468	Slowly... And with suspense!
1801469	You're laughing? Go ahead! Then, you will die.
1801470	Taste the sharpness of my blade and die.
1801471	Stab and twist. Simple, right?
1801472	My sword will cut through your armor like paper.
1801473	Ha!
1801474	What a pathetic end to carelessness...
1801475	I cannot stand any longer.
1801476	A bit more... Clench the teeth! Kyah!
1801477	Now, don't die too easily.
1801478	I am the guillotine. If you remember me from the past, that will be your carelessness.
1801479	See this nightmarish truth. How would you like to see your comrades die?
1801480	Your group attacks so easily. I am alone.
1801481	Swing and strike! You are just a lump of flesh.
1801482	Puhahahahaha! This is fun!
1801483	You killed many of my subordinates.
1801484	You can stand it, right? Good! That's good! Hahaha!
1801485	I'm getting more and more excited!
1801486	Insects! Insignificant bugs to be killed!
1801487	I'm the boss of this place! How dare you act with such impudence!!!
1801488	I'm feeling power! Must be Katarsis on the battlefield! Hahaha!
1801489	I hate all of you who are alive!
1801490	Undead? Don't label me so easily!
1801491	Kuhahahahaha! C'mon! Try some more!!
1801492	I will tear your soul at the tip of my spear.
1801493	Protect feelings? When you die, die with certainty!
1801494	This fortress is not your playground! How dare you!
1801495	Sadness surrounds me.
1801496	Do you know how it feels to die on those you love?
1801497	I will bring peace back to this place.
1801498	The guillotine of death is hiding your identity.
1801499	The guillotine always makes me cower.
1801500	Sometimes, I cannot accept my death.
1801501	I died without mercy in this place.
1801502	My brutal curse keeps me trapped in this place.
1801503	I cannot rely on anyone anymore.
1801504	Hurry and escape from this place...
1801505	I love you. Please don't forget me.
1801506	I really didn't want to die.
1801507	You! Can you see me?
1801508	This place is all filled with suffocating darkness!
1801509	My body was beaten to a pulp.
1801510	I will never forget the face of my torturer...!
1801511	My entire body was destroyed by fear.
1801512	No! Go away! Don't let anyone come toward me...!
1801513	I left my family behind and was dragged to this place.
1801514	If I let go of my grudge, will I be able to escape from this place?
1801515	I want to feel the ground under my feet. But I no longer have any weight.
1801516	Hot! Too hot!
1801517	The air here feels like it's burning!
1801518	Get away! Get that fire away from me!
1801519	Ack! AAAHHHH!!
1801520	I'm always covered in sweat. So pitiful...
1801521	I don't know how many times I pleaded for my life.
1801522	Please destroy the guillotine. That is my wish!
1801523	Crackle crackle... That sound drives me crazy.
1801524	I remember the eyes of the monsters that looked upon me...
1801525	Please... just kill me...
1801526	I hate red. The color of fire... and blood...
1801527	Kkk... Did you see that mysterious image at night?
1801528	I want to see the image that appears in the darkness.
1801529	Darkness and annihilation. Don't those words go well together?
1801530	Things you cannot see during the day appear at night.
1801531	Don't walk around carelessly. You might die in an instant!
1801532	Rare life forms appear here from time to time.
1801533	Have you ever held the Proof of Survival in your hand?
1801534	They say that the monster that carries around treasure holds it.
1801535	Isn't it illogical to search for money in a barren land?
1801536	Let go of your greed. There is a greater reward waiting for you.
1801537	Let go of the things you desire, so that good fortune finds you...
1801538	Treasure the time that you have, even if it's only 10 minutes.
1801539	People can obtain a great fortune in a short amount of time.
1801540	Don't worry about me. I will speak the truth until my dying day.
1801541	The mandragora plants had many varieties.
1801542	Skull Dissect... That monster doesn't dare show itself.
1801543	Do not fear their shields. It is just an illusion.
1801544	Do not obsess over the small things. Look with a wide view...
1801545	Their shields are strong. But they are also careless!
1801546	Hun.. hungry...
1801547	Aha~
1801548	If it's a lot, I'll eat more.
1801549	Wooowww!
1801550	No way! Stop! Ack!
1801551	You lot...!!
1801552	I'm getting hungry.
1801553	Your kids are really cute.
1801554	Have a good and safe day.
1801555	Who's there?
1801556	Where do you think you are?
1801557	Hey, stop!
1801558	You killed our baby!
1801559	Kyah! I won't forgive you!
1801560	Even if I die, I can't forgive you. We'll die together!
1801561	Everyone, come here.
1801562	Babies, you mustn't stray from your mom.
1801563	What should we have for dinner?
1801564	Mom, I'm hungry.
1801565	Mom and Dad, let's play.
1801566	Yap yap yap.
1801567	Stop fooling around and get to work!
1801568	Stop goofing off. Want a time-out? Or a spanking?
1801569	It's too late. Don't you know that it should have ended 30 minutes ago?
1801570	My machine is big and beautiful~
1801571	My machine is awesome~
1801572	Ooh yah~
1801573	Hey, wipe that correctly.
1801574	Come here and give me a massage. Nanim is still working and is probably tired.
1801575	A caterpillar should eat pine needles, right? Kekeke.
1801576	5 second(s) to go!
1801577	4 second(s) to go!
1801578	3 second(s) to go!
1801579	2 second(s) to go!
1801580	1 second(s) to go!
1801581	Let's rest for awhile.
1801582	The Chaos Shield is shattered and the true form is revealed!
1801583	Don't come this way!
1801584	This rat-like world!
1801585	What a big rat. Today will be a feast.
1801586	It sure is nice to be free from having to go to the bathroom.
1801587	Hoo~ Haa~ Hoo~ Haa~
1801588	Why did I come here? This lot!
1801589	This is all Tauti's fault!
1801590	What a worthwhile day!.
1801591	Today was terrible. I only caught 3 rats.
1801592	I'm hope to be an Engineer someday.
1801593	Today's dinner is a huge rat roast.
1801594	Get it right, or you're done! There's plenty Zofans that want this work.
1801595	Upward mobility? Don't make me laugh.
1801596	Well done. That rat body is your reward. Hahaha.
1801597	If you don't do better today, that's it for you!
1801598	What a nuisance you worthless creatures are!
1801599	Everyone die!
1801600	For Tauti!
1801601	Fools. I will make this a habitat for the rats. They shall feed on your body!
1801602	How dare you insects attack me?
1801603	You rat-like creatures!
1801604	Today is a feasting day for my weapon -- on your Petras!
1801605	Hahahaha hahahaha puny insects!
1801606	Everyone die!
1801607	For Tauti!
1801608	I will punish you in the name of Tauti! The crime is stealing. The punishment is death!
1801609	Fight for the sake of our future!
1801610	Even rats struggle when you step on them!
1801611	For our friends and family!
1801612	You worthless Kundas! My weapon may not be the bst, but it's still enough to cut your heads off!
1801613	Give me freedom or give me death!
1801614	Us! Today! Here! We shall write new history by defeating Tauti! For freedom and happiness!
1801615	We are not your pets or cattle!
1801616	You will die!     And I will live.
1801617	We cannot forgive Tauti for feeding on us anymore!
1801618	Fight for the sake of our future!
1801619	If we all fall here, our plan will certainly fail. Please protect my friends.
1801620	Kill that $s1 over there first. He is too ugly.
1801621	Flood in, my followers. I grant you permission.
1801622	Do you need my help. Here it is.
1801623	The plan has failed. Everyone, retreat!
1801624	Warning! Warning! Overheating has begun!
1801625	Warning! Warning! Coolant is leaking!

1802204	You…!
1802205	What...what is this power…?

1802209	How dare you try to harm me with your evil schemes!
1802210	Feel for yourself…the strength of my will!
1802211	I don't have much time left…
1802212	Such deadly aura… haven't felt the likes of this in years!
1802213	Are you trying to make me die a second death?
1802214	His Majesty Travis has ordered immediate execution!
1802215	Agh! My eye! My eye!
1802216	Do not defile this place with your presence!
1802217	We were the ones who cleansed this place of evil pests!

1802221	What is this! So disorienting!
1802222	So you killed my comrades, did you?!

1802224	Let me be blind…let me be deaf… but I will not stop!!
1802225	Remember our history…our glorious history!
1802226	I cannot…I will not…back down!
1802227	A mountain of corpses…
1802228	My slumbering muscles begin to wake…
1802229	No use trying your petty tricks!
1802230	I'm ten steps ahead of you. Don't bother trying.
1802231	We haven't even begun yet.
1802232	Are you watching? Watch… and feel what true fear is!
1802233	Who are you? You weren't here before..
1802234	Look upon this great grave, and tell me you see nothing!
1802235	The dead shall pass judgment on the living!
1802236	Heh, interesting trick you use there.
1802237	Now, your turn!

1802254	Are you not ashamed before the gods?!
1802255	Shilen…Shilen. Such is the name imprinted in my memory…
1802256	I am Travis! I shall not bow down to you!
1802257	Not enough time…not enough time at all.

1802351	This has been too taxing on us all.

1802930	Master Kelbim won't let you just be!
1802931	Be ready. They might come out any time.
1802932	Did you think you could escape? Take back the stronghold and the captives.
1802933	Barton from the Aden Vanguard has been freed. You are done for.
1802934	Ugh... did we get caught again? What's the captain doing?
1802935	Are Captain Adolph and the others safe? I'm going back to the battle.
1802936	This place is dangerous. We need reinforcements.
1802937	We have to stop Kelbim and the Atelia explosion. Don't worry about me.
1802938	Caught yet again? What you are doing?
1802939	Interesting. I'll show you my full power now.
1802940	You puny insects! Feel my wrath!
1802941	This is not over!
1802942	Warriors of the Embryo. Attack!
1802943	How did I lose?

1802945	Kelbim has transformed to become even stronger.
1802946	Kelbim is making his last-ditch effort.
1802947	Kelbim is calling his underlings to protect him.
1802948	Kelbim has been defeated by the courageous warriors.
1802949	Someone activated the emission of the polluting Atelia gas in the Atelia Castle.
1802950	Someone deactivated the emission of the polluting Atelia gas in the Atelia Castle.
1802951	Brothers of the Embryo… Get up again and protect the fortress.

1802953	I can feel the energy from the Atelia! Feel the power of Kelbim!
1802954	Liona and the lowly soldiers will be buried here.
1802955	Show them the power of Kelbim.
1802956	Too bad! Good luck next time.

1802972	Come here, I'll teach you a lesson.
1802973	Hey! Hey, you! Come here!
1802974	Open this!
1802975	Open this box!
1802976	Who are you?!
1802977	Not just anyone can go in. Leave!
1802978	How do you dare pass through here?
1802979	What? Who are you?
1802980	We must alert the Commander about these intruders!
1802981	Alert everyone!
1802982	How did you know I was here?
1802983	Why are you so late? Huh? You are not part of the Ashen Shadow Revolutionaries!
1802984	I'll have to silence you in order to hide the fact I'm a spy.
1802985	You think you can leave this place alive after seeing me?
1802986	Wait, wait. It will be better for you if you let me live.
1802987	Stop! I only helped the Ashen Shadow Revolutionaries for a little!
1802988	Ashen Shadow Revolutionaries! Keep the formation!

1803000	All the recruits are to train and follow the sergeants!
1803001	Soldiers, we have guests. Welcome them.
1803002	Commander Burnstein, there's no need for you to deal with these. I'll take care of them.
1803003	I'll show you something interesting. Come to the second floor.
1803004	Stop the infiltrators!
1803005	Don't let a single one leave this place alive!
1803006	This is the place where your comrades are reborn as a soldier of Embryo.
1803007	Look closely. You might recognize some of them. Let's see if they are ready to become our soldiers.
1803008	The Aden Vanguard? Huh. I'm surprised you are able to withstand the brainwashing. Have a good time fighting against your comrades.
1803009	Doesn't matter. We already have great elite soldiers who we've successfully converted.
1803010	Useless bunch… I'll deal with you.
1803011	Commander Burnstein… I wasn't able to complete my mission…
1803012	It will be better for us if we capture you, rather than the countless useless soldiers.
1803013	How about receiving the blessing of Atelia and becoming an elite soldier under me?
1803014	There's no room for negotiations. I don't really care.
1803015	Don't even think about leaving this place alive.

1803041	I'm the shield of the Dragonclaw clan!
1803042	I failed to live up to my role as the shield of the clan..

1803051	We'll take care of this. You go defeat Kelbim!
1803052	Stupid Haren! He was boasting that he would protect the Altar of Earth..
1803053	Remove that dirty hand!
1803054	I give up! Please don't kill me..
1803055	$s1, you've received the Altar of Wind Sealing Stone.
1803056	Use the Altar of Wind Sealing Stone to seal the Altar of Wind!
1803057	The Altar of Wind has been sealed! Now go on to the Dungeon!
1803058	You've successfully sealed the Altar of Wind!

1803060	My blade is waiting for your blood.
1803061	You rebels! This is as far as you'll get!
1803062	You call that an attack?
1803063	Come out! Hurricane! Cyclone!
1803064	I can't believe I lost to the likes of you..
1803065	Krrrrrr!
1803066	Please let me out!
1803067	The door to Kelbim's throne has opened!
1803068	I knew you would come.
1803069	A lot of people are suffering because of the Dragonclaw and Kelbim!
1803070	Now is time to burn the Dragonclaw's flag!
1803071	Kelbim! Punish that guy!
1803072	Kelbim is on the other side.
1803073	Please defeat Kelbim no matter what!
1803074	The door to Kelbim's throne has opened!
1803075	Protect Kelbim!
1803076	For Dragonclaw!
1803077	Punitive creatures! I will make you pay for your rebellion!
1803078	I'm the master of Dragonclaw!
1803079	I don't lose to anyone!
1803080	How did I lose..
1803081	Are you the leader? I'm so glad you are helping out.
1803082	I almost died a few times excavating.
1803083	Since we know of this great treasure, I'll make sure to reward you if we find it.
1803084	I'm glad you are on my side! I'm excited!
1803085	Watch out. There are a lot of monsters around here.
1803086	Are you the ones who will be helping out? Welcome. I've been waiting for you.
1803087	I had a hard time working by myself. I'm glad you are here now.
1803088	Don't worry about the reward! We'll find that treasure.
1803089	I'm glad powerful people like you guys are helping me.
1803090	Wow! Watch out! Monsters might come out any minute now.
1803091	Hello! I'm Deton, an archaeologist of the Kingdom of Aden.
1803092	I don't know what I would've done without you here. Thanks for helping.
1803093	I'm sure it will be a great treasure, so I'll make sure to reward you accordingly.
1803094	Glad to have powerful people like you on my side.
1803095	Watch out! There are monsters everywhere.
1803096	Oh? This is a Flame Flower! Stand back. The Stakatos will come now.
1803097	The Flame Flowers can only be saved with the Radiant Heal skill.
1803098	Be careful. The flower will die if you hit it with another skill.
1803099	Phew.. Those Stakatos.. They shouldn't come out for a while now.
1803100	A Flame Flower! Can you believe it? It's a very magical flower.
1803101	To save a Flame Flower.. Yes, you need to use Radiant Heal!
1803102	If you try to use any other skill, the flower will die, so be careful.
1803103	Those nasty Stakatos.. Anyway, it should be fine now.
1803104	This!! I'm sure I've seen this before.. Yes.. That means, the Stakatos!!
1803105	To save the Flame Flower you need Heal.. Wait! Radiant Heal! Yes, I'm sure!
1803106	Well, there's not much difference, right? Or is there..?
1803107	Anyway, the Stakatos will not come out anymore. Why? Well..
1803108	Now, on to the next!
1803109	Hmm? What is this? I don't think I've been around here before.. This eerie feeling..
1803110	Wah! Save me! Saaaave me! I'll give you a thousand Adena!!!
1803111	Let's keep going.
1803112	What's this place? I've never seen this before.. Hmm..
1803113	Wah! Save me! Please save me!
1803114	Let's have some fun.
1803115	Let's see.. I haven't been here before. Have I? I hope we don't run into weird creatures..
1803116	Eek! Save this Dwarf! I'm just an archaeologist! I'll give you everything I have!!
1803117	Eeeek! Great! I can't believe you defeated this giant scorpion!
1803118	Well, let's keep going. Which way do you want to go? Left or right?
1803119	I have a bad feeling about both, but I'll trust you guys.
1803120	Oh? You truly are amazing. You actually defeated those nasty guys!
1803121	The path splits now. Well, let's go! Which way?
1803122	Both look pretty bad, but we must keep going!
1803123	Eek! Don't bring it here. Anyway, you really are strong.
1803124	Let's hurry. Which way? Test your luck at this crossroads.
1803125	I'm worried either way, but I'll trust you guys.
1803126	This way? Well, I trust you. I'll be safe, right?
1803127	What! Look, this place isn't safe either!
1803128	Eek! What..? Wait! I'll be waiting over there..
1803129	You are decided? Well, let's hurry!
1803130	Wahhh! It's dangerous! Watch out!
1803131	Wait! I mean, good job. I'll just be waiting over there..
1803132	This way? I see. Okay. I just need to follow you, right?
1803133	Wahhh! This way was dangerous too! Save me!
1803134	Huh? I think I saw something. I'll be right back.
1803135	This way feels much safer. Good choice. The air feels different.
1803136	Wahhh! What are these monsters! How old do you have be to get that big!
1803137	Please get rid of these monsters. I'm sure it will be easy for you. I.. Have something to take care of..
1803138	Okay, it does look better than the other way. The air feels better already.
1803139	Again!! Please do something about those monsters! Where do they keep coming from?
1803140	I'll leave those monsters to you. I'll go check out something over there. It's very important.
1803141	Well, does it matter which way we go? I hope it's better than the other one at least.. Something smells good here.
1803142	Wahh! Why do these monsters keep coming out? I should hunt them all and make some drinks.. Wah! Don't come near me!
1803143	Do something about these monsters! Show me your strength! I'll be waiting over there..
1803144	Oh! I've never been this far. This ancient language.. Isn't it beautiful?
1803145	It says.. "The Sealed Tablet and the Sealing Device are one body.. The Flame Flowers will be your blessing.."
1803146	The seal is coming apart! Just a little more!
1803147	Yes! The seal is gone. Well, you go on ahead. I'll make some rubbed copies first.
1803148	This.. Looks like instructions on how to remove the seal..
1803149	Sealed Tablet.. Attack.. The Flame Flowers.. Oh! Plant the Flame Flowers around the tablet and attack it! Now!
1803150	Yes! The seal is coming apart. Come on, let's do this!
1803151	The seal is gone! Let's go now! I'll look around once more. You go on ahead!
1803152	Hmm.. Can you read this? I should've paid more attention in the ancient language class..
1803153	Well, we should try to destroy the tablet first. Something should happen then, right?
1803154	Oh, yes! Look at that. The seal is breaking! Just a little more.
1803155	Wow! The seal is gone! Ohhh! That's a pretty big hole. Well, grab on to my hand, and you may go in first.
1803156	What's going on? Everyone's fighting very hard for me, I see.
1803157	Huh? You actually thought we were going to share the treasures? Hah! Nice try.
1803158	The powerful Tauti! I finally got it! It's mine!! Kahaha.
1803159	This power.. I can feel it! Hm? Huh? What's this? Gwahhh!
1803160	You are all fighting so hard for me!
1803161	You fools! These treasures are mine! I was just using you all. Kuhaha.
1803162	Tauti! The weapon that grants great power! This is mine now! Kahahaha!
1803163	Kuh! What's this? I thought I would get more power..! Gwahhh!
1803164	Nice, nice. I see that everyone's fighting hard for me.
1803165	I can't believe you actually fell for that. I was just using you. Kahaha.
1803166	Tauti! So this is Tauti. Give me your power! You are mine! Kahahaha!
1803167	Kahahaha! I can feel the power. Yes.. This..? What.. This is not it! Gwah!
1803168	Phew! It's hot in here. I've been here for over twenty years, but this is way too hot.
1803169	Have I told you? My brothers' names are Ceton and Eton. Hahaha
1803170	I used to be lean when I was young, but I guess this belly fat comes with age. You could say this is attractive in its own way.
1803171	I heard that Tyrr Warrior Dwarves can't attack long range when jumping. Is that true? Just wondering..
1803172	People used to think I was very old when I was a kid, but nowadays, everyone says I look younger than I am! Hahaha.
1803173	You don't belong here!
1803174	An evil thing has been sealed here. Do not get any closer.
1803175	Are you not afraid of the gods' wrath?
1803176	Do not lust after what's sealed here. It is not yours.
1803177	I will forgive you if you retreat now.
1803178	How stupid. Ignorance is a sin. I'll let you go this one time. Go!
1803179	I cannot let those who were not able to win against themselves advance any further.
1803180	Gods. Please show your powers to those who seek the devil.
1803181	Don't even dream about it! Those who are not qualified won't even get a chance!
1803182	Tauti is a cursed weapon. It must not be awakened.
1803183	Why don't you believe me!
1803184	Why are you seeking the devil's weapon? Stop!
1803185	Do not let things get worse than this.
1803186	Tauti must remain sealed here.
1803187	The seal must not be undone.
1803188	We have infiltrators. Protect the princess!
1803189	How dare you come in to the princess' room!
1803190	They came all the way here? We must stop them!
1803191	Die, you monster!
1803192	Guhhhh.
1803193	Are you ready to hear the story?
1803194	I'll start once everyone is seated.

1811299	$s1, your empathy is appreciated.
1811300	Thank you for attending this mourning service. It is alright to show your sorrow…
1811301	The name is Janson... Bow your head and show some respect for the dead.
1811302	Remaining Time
1811303	The beach where relics of Giants had fallen has now become clean.
1811304	Occasionally rare jewels of Giants are discovered in the beach.
1811305	There is a day where you can see even the Aden continent if the weather is good.
1811306	If I'm here, it feels like time has stopped.
1811307	Perhaps even the village becomes dangerous?
1811308	Speak with me about traveling around Aden.
1811309	Hey guys! Don't go too far~
1811310	Rumors say that these heroes have set unbelievable records.
1811311	According to this, records are broken every month.
1811312	Wanna try a Kukuri race?
1811313	The land of Aden is in need of materials to rebuild from Shilen's destruction.
1811314	Please donate any unused materials you have to help rebuild Aden.
1811315	You'll receive a gift for any applicable donation.
1811316	Istina is hiding itself in the twisted space.
1811317	Maguen quickly hides after stealing the bio-energy residue.
1811318	You cannot teleport while you are dead.
1811319	Nonsense!!
1811320	You poor and pitiful creature!
1811321	The Daemon Angma Mastermind has appeared in the Dark Elf Village.
1811322	Our leader is around this village.
1811323	Would you care to die?
1811324	You want a piece of me!
1811325	That's what I thought, all talk!
1811326	Thank you! And now you die!
1811327	It's time to turn that frown upside down… it's party town!
1811328	Enjoy the festivities!
1811329	Come on, let's dance!
1811330	Time to get down and get funky!
1811331	Hahaha, I've got the best steps.
1811332	May I have this dance?
1811333	Which Echo Crystals do you have? I have them all, Feast, Love, and Celebration.
1811334	Are you ready to bust a groove?
1811335	Wow, $s1 has serious moves!
1811336	Oh, I'm so embarrassed...
1811337	$s1 seems a little shy.
1811338	Wahaha~ How fun!
1811339	Put your hands up!
1811340	You obtained a poisonous Tama... Thank you, $s1.
1811341	I am looking for the poisonous Tama that only grows in the Cruma Marshlands, the Swamp of Screams, and the Bloody Swampland.
1811342	Have you obtained the plant? I will send you to the Cardia Adventurer.
1811343	The red tama is more effective~! You can see the adventurer's location on the map.
1811344	Use the Fearsome Firecracker on the Bat Colony.
1811345	Wow, thanks!
1811346	If you excuse me, I need to find a hiding spot.
1811347	Replenish ballista magic power
1811740	Apherus Garden Door was opened.
1811750	Intruder! I will let you know the strength of my power!
1811760	Apherus is out of energy. No longer moving.
1811770	I've brought a guard as a payback!
1811780	How dare you! Attack!
1811790	Moved to Apherus dimension.
1900000	Kehahaha!!! I captured Santa!! There will be no gifts this year!!!
1900001	Now! Why don't you take the challenge?
1900002	Come on, I'll take all of you on!
1900003	Well? I win, right?
1900004	Now!! All of you losers, get out of here!
1900005	What a bunch of losers.
1900006	I guess you came to rescue Santa. But you picked the wrong opponent.
1900007	Oh, not bad...
1900008	Agh!! That's not what I meant to do!
1900009	Curse you!! Huh... What...?
1900010	Have you done nothing but rock-paper-scissors?!
1900011	Stop it, no more... I did it because I was too lonely...
1900012	I have to release Santa... How infuriating!!!
1900013	I hate happy Happy Holidays!!!
1900014	Oh. I'm bored.
1900015	Shall I go to see if Santa is still there? Hehe~
1900016	Oh ho ho.... Happy Holidays!!
1900017	Santa can give nice presents only if he's released from the Turkey...
1900018	Oh ho ho... Oh ho ho... Thank you. Everyone!  I will repay you for sure.
1900019	Happy Holidays~ Well done.
1900020	Happy Holidays~ Thank you for rescuing me from that wretched Turkey.
1900021	%s. I have prepared a gift for you.
1900022	I have a gift for %s.
1900023	Take a look at the inventory. I hope you like the gift I gave you.
1900024	Take a look at the inventory. Perhaps there will be a big present~
1900025	I'm tired of dealing with you. I'm leaving.
1900026	When are you going to stop? I'm slowly getting tired of this.
1900027	Message from Santa: Many blessings to %s, who saved me~
1900028	How dare you awaken me. Feel the pain of the flames.
1900029	Who dares oppose the majesty of fire...?
1900030	Oh... Ouch! No, not there! Not my bead!
1900031	Co... Cold! That's cold! Ack! Ack!
1900032	Please, %s... Don't hit me... Please.
1900033	Kuaaannggg! Shake in fear!
1900034	If you attack me right now, you're really going to get it!!!
1900035	Just you wait! I'm going to show you my killer technique.
1900036	You don't dare attack me!
1900037	It's different from the Fire Spirit. It's not the Fire Spirit! Feel my wrath!
1900038	Cold... This place...  Is this where I die...?
1900039	My body is cooling. Oh, Gran Kain... Forgive me...
1900040	Idiot! I only incur damage from bare-handed attacks!
1900041	You summoned me, so you must be confident, huh? Here I come! Jack game!
1900042	Hello. Let's have a good Jack game.
1900043	I'm starting! Now, show me the card you want!
1900044	We'll start now! Show me the card you want!
1900045	I'm showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1900046	I'll be showing the Rotten Pumpkin Card!
1900047	I'm showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1900048	I'll be showing the Jack Pumpkin Card!
1900049	That's my precious Fantastic Chocolate Banana Ultra Favor Candy!!! I'm definitely winning the next round!!
1900050	It's my precious candy, but... I'll happily give it to you~!
1900051	I'm out of candy. I'll give you my toy chest instead.
1900052	Since I'm out of candy, I will give you my toy chest instead.
1900053	You're not peeking at my card, are you? This time, I'll wager a special scroll.
1900054	We're getting serious now. If you win again, I'll give you a special scroll.
1900055	You could probably enter the underworld pro league!
1900056	Even pros can't do this much. You're amazing.
1900057	Who's the monster here?! This time, I'll bet my precious Transformation Stick.
1900058	I lost again. I won't lose this time. I'm betting my Transformation Stick.
1900059	Lost again! Hmph. Next time, I'll bet an incredible gift! Wait for it if you want!
1900060	You're too good. Next time, I'll give you an incredible gift! Please wait for it.
1900061	My pride can't handle you winning anymore!
1900062	I would be embarrassed to lose again here...
1900063	What's your name? I'm gonna remember you!
1900064	People from the above ground world are really good at games.
1900065	You've played a lot in the underworld, haven't you?!
1900066	I've never met someone so good before.
1900067	13 wins in a row. You're pretty lucky today, huh?
1900068	I never thought I would see 13 wins in a row.
1900069	This is the highest record in my life! Next time, I'll give you my treasure -- the Golden Jack O'Lantern!
1900070	Even pros can't do 14 wins in a row...! Next time, I'll give you my treasure, the Golden Jack O'Lantern
1900071	I can't do this anymore! You win! In all my 583 years, you're the best that I've seen!
1900072	Playing any more is meaningless. You were my greatest opponent.
1900073	I won this round...! It was fun.
1900074	I won this round. It was enjoyable.
1900075	Above world people are so fun...! Then, see you later!
1900076	Call me again next time. I want to play again with you.
1900077	You wanna play some more? I'm out of presents, but I'll give you candy!
1900078	Will you play some more? I don't have any more presents, but I will give you candy if you win.
1900079	You're the best. Out of all the Jack's game players I've ever met... I give up!
1900080	Wowww. Awesome. Really. I have never met someone as good as you before. Now... I can't play anymore.
1900081	%s has won %s Jack's games in a row.
1900082	Congratulations! %s has won %s Jack's games in a row.
1900083	Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game!
1900084	Hello~! I'm Belldandy. Congratulations on getting 1st place in Jack's game. If you go and find my sibling Skooldie in the village, you'll get an amazing gift! Let's play Jack's game again!
1900085	Hmm. You're playing Jack's game for the first time, huh? You couldn't even take out your card at the right time~! My goodness...
1900086	Oh. You're not very familiar with Jack's game, right? You didn't take out your card at the right time...
1900087	You have to use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1900088	You must use the card skill on the mask before the gauge above my head disappears.
1900089	If you show the same card as me, you win. If they're different, I win. Understand? Now, let's go!
1900090	You will win if you show the same card as me. It's my victory if the cards are different. Well, let's start again~
1900091	Ack! You didn't show a card? You have to use the card skill before the gauge disappears. Hmph. Then, I'm going.
1900092	Ahh. You didn't show a card. You must use the card skill at the right time. It's unfortunate. Then, I will go now~
1900093	Let's learn about the Jack's game together~! You can play with me 3 times.
1900094	Let's start! Show the card you want! The card skill is attached to the mask.
1900095	You showed the same card as me, so you win.
1900096	You showed a different card from me, so you lose.
1900097	That was practice, so there's no candy even if you win~
1900098	It's unfortunate. Let's practice one more time.
1900099	You gotta show the card at the right time. Use the card skill you want before the gauge above my head disappears!
1900100	The card skills are attached to the Jack O'Lantern mask, right? That's what you use.
1900101	You win if you show the same card as me, and I win if the cards are different. OK, let's go~
1900102	You didn't show a card again? We'll try again later. I'm gonna go now~
1900103	Now, do you understand a little about Jack's game? The real game's with Uldie and Belldandy. Well, see you later!
1900104	Yawn~ Ahh... Hello~! Nice weather we're having.
1900105	Ah, I'm hungry. Do you have any baby food? That's what I need to eat to get bigger.
1900106	I gotta grow up fast. I want to pull Santa's sled, too.
1900107	Yummy! I think I can grow up now!
1900108	Thanks to you, I grew up into a Boy Rudolph!
1900109	It's great weather for running around.
1900110	What'll I be when I grow up? I wonder.
1900111	If you take good care of me, I'll never forget it!
1900112	Please pet me lovingly. You can use the "Hand of Warmth" skill under the action tab.
1900113	I feel great! Thank you!
1900114	Woo. What a good feeling~ I gotta grow more and more!
1900115	Oh, yummy! If I keep eating this, I think I can grow up all the way.
1900116	Yum yum. Delicious. Give me more of this!
1900117	Wow. This taste. There's a whole new world in my mouth!
1900118	Yeah. It's so delicious. This is that star food!
1900119	Pay some attention to me! Hmph.
1900120	Thank you. I was able to grow up into an adult. Here is my gift.
1900121	Thank you. %s. Now, I can pull the sled.
1900122	%s. Thank you for taking care of me all this time. I enjoyed it very much.
1900123	%s. It won't be long now until it becomes time to pull the sled. It's too bad.
1900124	I must return to Santa now. Thank you for everything!
1900125	Hello. I'm a girl Rudolph. I was able to find my true self thanks to you.
1900126	This is my gift of thanks. Thank you for taking care of me~
1900127	%s. I was always grateful.
1900128	I'm a little sad. It's time to leave now.
1900129	%s. The time has come for me to return to my home.
1900130	%s. Thank you.
1900131	Hahaha!!! I captured Santa!! Huh? Where is this? Who are you?
1900132	...I lost at Rock Paper Scissors and was taken captive... I might as well take out my anger on you! Huh~ What?
1900133	Nothing's working... I'm leaving! I'll definitely capture Santa again! Just you wait!
1900134	I must raise Rudolph quickly. This year's Christmas gifts have to be delivered...
1900135	Happy Holidays~ Thanks to your efforts in raising Rudolph, the gift delivery was a success.
1900136	In 10 minutes, it will be 1 hour since you started raising me.
1900137	After 5 minutes, if my Full Feeling and Affection Level reach 99%, I can grow bigger.
1900138	The resupply time of %s hour(s) %s minute(s) %s second(s) remain for the Gift of Energy.
1900139	Want to test your luck? Give me Adena!
1900140	If you give me Adena 5 times, I will test your luck!
1900141	Yummy. I feel good today!
1900142	Yamyam. This doesn't feel very good.
1900143	I'm full~ I'll tell your fortune!
1900144	Thank you. See you later~
1900145	Today is the best day of your life! Congratulations! Only good things will come today.
1900146	You're very lucky today! You should enchant on days like this!
1900147	Ha.. Sorry, but today is not looking very good. Watch out for monsters!
1900148	Death! Death is near! No one can do anything about it! Muhaha... Ahhahahaha!
1900149	Everyone.. Turn into flesh! Kekekeke...
1900150	Black color ate.. all... of red blood! Understand?!
1900151	All gonna die! Smashed like meat.. Will get sucked into the darkness!
1900152	I don't wanna die... sniff.. I... don't want to die like that..
1900153	Don't...come.. Go away! Ahh...ahhh!
1900154	Give you life to the Goddess of Death! Kahahaha!
1900155	It's not yet complete! Death! Is not yet complete!
1900156	No.. I.. can't die like this. Go...go away!
1900157	I saw.. blood.. torn flesh... getting...sucked into... the ground...
1900158	Ughh.... blood.. drips... bone.... crushed...
1900159	Voice.. was good... as if you're possessed... No! I'm already possessed!
1900160	I heard the sound. Sacrifice your blood now. You'll resurrect later! Kehehehe!
1900161	Don't die! But, you will. I will! You too! Hehehe!
1900162	I saw... the end of darkness... I had to give up.
1900163	Flesh rips...bone crushes. Haha...hehehe...it's red. All!
1900164	I do not...want to die. I don't want to...die miserably like that!
1900165	Go away! I do not want to see anyone! No... Don't leave me! I'm scared!
1900166	I didn't want to see. Hehe.. But, I saw.. I saw! Hehehehe!
1900167	I heard the sound. Sound of the hell!
1900168	Let me.. live!! Please! Help me! That black ground is trying to swallow me!
1900169	Hundreds and thousands of monsters turned into flesh! Kehehehe!
1900170	I was swallowed after smashed. By darkness! Into the darkness!
1900171	I don't like it! Don't touch me! Please.. I beg you... Sniff... Sniff...
1900172	Sweet voice. Hehe.. You die if you get possessed by that sound. Like them! Hehe...hahaha!
1900173	They will resurrect. She will... They will... Heh...
1900174	Dead.. or alive... I don't want to see anything..
1900175	Death. No one can do anything! Deep! Deep death!
1900176	Even if you try, it's useless. Die with me. Keheheh!
1900177	Dark voice.. Can you hear? I.. can hear.. But... I don't want to..
1900178	I can still hear the sound.. of flesh and bones grinding. Hehehehe!
1900179	Eek! Run away! If you want to live... If you want to stay alive! Leave here! Right now!
1900180	You don't want to die? But, you'll die soon. Keheheh!
1900181	There's no chance! No chance at all! You! And I will! Become red flesh! Keheheh!
1900182	Die! Before she swallows you! Die!
1900183	Don't wanna die. But, I can't live either. Sniff... Sniff...
1900184	Eek! Don't kill me! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna become a patty of meat.. No.. No!
1900185	I can hear.. the bone crushing sound..
1900186	I saw the sea of blood. That day..I.. Ahhhh!
1900187	I couldn't run.. I saw... Everything! I was already dead then. Kehe...hahaha..
1900188	I'm gonna get caught! Then you'll die! Ahh! God have forsaken us!
1900189	I want to live! I don't want to be swallowed to death!
1900190	Nothing comes out neither from inside or outside.
1900191	As it didn't exist
1900192	It left nothing behind..
1900193	Should we report it to the kingdom?
1900194	I'm in a pickle. We can't go back. Let's look further.
1900195	We'll begin internal purification process.
1900196	Please.
1900197	Nothing can be found.
1900198	As if it didn't exist from the beginning
1900199	Hm..
1900200	I heard the witness went crazy after this incident.
1900201	I think we must begin purifying this bad aura before we do anything.
1900202	I will report to Kingdom.
1900203	Yes. You can do that.
1900204	From what I heard from the witness, I heard the monsters were completely ripped apart and absorbed into the ground.
1900205	He's a crazy man, so it's not so credible...
1900206	Sigh.. It doesn't make sense that this brutal scene has nothing left behind.
1900207	What should we do?
1900208	Let's report it to the kingdom first.
1900209	Okay.
1900210	A crazy man said all the monsters were shredded and absorbed into the ground.
1900211	What do you think?
1900212	Unbelievable words from unbelievable man.
1900213	I think so too. But, there's no practical way to explain why the monsters have disappeared..
1900214	Sigh.. We'll begin internal purification process.
1900215	Yes. Then I will report back to the Kingdom.
1900216	I can't believe it.
1900217	Monsters all disappeared at once...
1900218	I never felt this kind of deep darkness before.
1900219	I wonder if we can purify this.
1900220	This may be difficult, but please.
1900221	Stop outsiders from approaching.
1900222	Okay.
1900223	Sigh..
1900224	Other places can't seem to find anything either.
1900225	If it's even possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis...
1900226	The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful.
1900227	I think we must eliminate this dark aura first.
1900228	I think you should investigate afterwards.
1900229	Please.
1900230	Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear at once?
1900231	I.. don't believe that it's possible.
1900232	I don't think it's possible...
1900233	The witness went crazy. His words are meaningless.
1900234	Sigh.. It's tiring trying to guess.
1900235	First.. Please take care of the purification process.
1900236	Then I will report back to the Kingdom.
1900237	Okay.
1900238	I'm worried.
1900239	Other places can't seem to find anything either.
1900240	Do you think it's possible for all monsters to disappear from all catacombs and necropolis?
1900241	The witness went crazy. He's not being very helpful.
1900242	I think we must eliminate this dark aura first.
1900243	Please.
1900244	Ahh.. What should we do with this situation...
1900245	Calm down.
1900246	Does it even make sense that all monsters from Catacomb and Necropolis disappeared?
1900247	This has never happened in the past.
1900248	First.. Calm down...
1900249	Shilen...Shilen may be resurrecting...
1900250	Sigh.. First... I will start with purification process.
1900251	When you're calm, please report to the kingdom.
1900252	What do you think?
1900253	This doesn't seem like an ordinary situation.
1900254	If that crazy man's words are true... Monsters... May have been... absorbed by Shilen.
1900255	Shilen.. I don't even know how to report for this.
1900256	I will purify this place first.
1900257	Please.
1900258	What he said is out of ordinary.
1900259	The monsters were shredded into pieces and absorbed into the ground...
1900260	This is not something any person can do.
1900261	Then... I see... Shilen sounds like a viable theory.
1900262	It may not be the truth.
1900263	You may be correct.
1900264	We should report to the Kingdom first.
1900265	Okay.
1900266	Ha.. I have no idea.
1900267	I can't find any trace. Any trace of the monsters!
1900268	Calm down.
1900269	No race can do such thing.
1900270	If anyone could... he would be 'God.'
1900271	First.. We'll purify this evil aura.
1900272	Please.
1900273	We'll go into investigation when the purification is complete.
1900274	Okay.
1900275	What do you think about what that crazy man said?
1900276	It sounds like crazy talk from a crazy man?
1900277	When there's no proof... Don't you think it sounds pretty credible?
1900278	You're putting too much weight into it.
1900279	It's unrealistic that all monsters would disappear at once.
1900280	Even if you believe that... there's really not much we can do.
1900281	Please purify inside of the building.
1900282	Okay.
1900283	It's a strange thing.
1900284	Right. It's definitely not a human being can do.
1900285	Monsters all disappeared at once...
1900286	Do you think God did this?
1900287	Someone who can do this... is probably... Goddess of Death...
1900288	That's the worst guess.
1900289	I think it's best that we do not tell the Kingdom yet.
1900290	We must find something that can be a clue...
1910172	Show respect to the heroes who defeated the evil dragon and protected this Aden world!
1910173	Shout to celebrate the victory of the heroes!
1910174	Praise the achievement of the heroes and receive Tersi's blessing!
1911111	You will soon become the sacrifice for us, those full of deceit and sin whom you despise!
1911112	My brethren who are stronger than me will punish you. You will soon be covered in your own blood and crying in anguish!
1911113	How could I lose against these worthless creatures...?
1911114	Foolish creatures... the flames of hell are drawing closer.
1911115	No matter how you struggle this place will soon be covered with your blood.
1911116	Those who set foot in this place shall not leave alive.
1911117	Worthless creatures, I will grant you eternal sleep in fire and brimstone.
1911118	If you wish to see hell, I will grant you your wish.
1911119	Elapsed Time :
1911120	Time Remaining :
2000000	Is this the surface world?
2000001	I can feel a dangerous energy! I must find young mistress and young master as soon as possible...
2000002	Urgh! Above world people are stronger than I thought~ I'll need to leave a trace to let young master and young mistress know that I was here.
2000003	I'm not strong enough! But I won't give up. I will go to the underworld to recharge my energy, then I will come back.
2000004	Miss Uldie! Where are you? It's time to return to the underworld.
2000005	Miss Belldandy! The master is searching for you.
2000006	Young master Skooldie! It's time to go home. Where are you?
2000007	You rude above world people! Stop being so discourteous!
2000008	You above world people! Feel the amazing power of this great Norhand!
2000009	You above world people! It is time for you to go back the way you came.
2000010	You received stage 1 Holiday Blessing.

2000012	You received stage 3 Holiday Blessing.
2000013	You received stage 4 Holiday Blessing.
2000014	You received stage 5 Holiday Blessing.
2000015	Hey, who are you? Get off! This tree decoration is mine!!
2000016	Give yourself in to your instincts, new ruler! Seek true power!
2000017	The Mysterious Power of Kartia's Labyrinth shall give you great power.
2000018	Keep the Crystal of Protection safe from enemies!
2000019	Claim the Source of Kartia's Power, and taste the sweetness of true strength!
2000020	You cannot show your condolences yet. Please try again later.
2000021	You are too far from Uthanka's Tombstone to show your condolences.
2000022	You have mourned for the Pirate Captain Uthanka.
2000023	Hey, let's duke it out, you and me! Haven't worked up a sweat for a while!
2000024	Ouch! That hurts! Stop it stop it stop it!
2000025	How could you do that to me! I'm the Great Captain Uthanka, back after being gone for, like, ever!
2000026	You have received the Mysterious Power of Kartia's Labyrinth.
2000027	You have received the Strong Mysterious Power of Kartia's Labyrinth.
2000028	I rest my hopes on your feats.
2000029	I have seen your true powers. Please allow me to follow you.
2000030	I offer you all that I have, Master.
2000031	It seems your fate ends here.
2000032	You're an interesting one… I can feel the power of the giants from you, and you're not even a giant!
2000033	Display your dominance over either Kajin or Beryn,#and the other one will submit to you.
2000034	The Ancient Kartia Records hold the beginning and the end of Ancient Kartia's Labyrinth,#and everything in between.
2000035	Wait, don't tell me you don't recognize the Great Pirate Captain Uthanka?!
2000036	Well, for starters, the Great Pirate Captain Uthanka - that's me - was the ruler of the very Talking Island you're standing on!
2000037	Back in those days, nobodies like you wouldn't have stood a chance against the likes of me.
2000038	Well, all that came to an end when Ye Sagira crashed onto the Talking Island because of Shilen's resurrection, so it's all done and past, I guess…
2000039	If it hadn't been for that, this island would have stayed under my great rule.
2000040	Ah, the good old days…
2000041	What, still here? You were actually listening?
2000042	Ahem, eh, well, thanks…
2000043	Well, since you stayed to hear my story, I can't let you leave empty-handed now, can I?
2000044	I'll give you a special gift. It's not for everyone, mind you! It's the most valuable thing in the history of Aden!
2000045	It's in your pouch, so use it well, you hear?
2000046	Man, I'm tired… I forgot how much talking can wear you out!
2000047	Only one ruler left! Let's finish this up!
2000048	Everyone watch out for ice shards when debuffing.
2000049	So sleepy… better finish this fast so I can go sleep!
2000050	Now, don't make yourself look stupid. Finish it clean.
2000051	Watch out for lags, and start! Go, go, go!
2000052	Man, that hurts like hell! Heal, give me a heal!
2000053	The buffs are out! Give me buffs!
2000054	Pattern 2 begun! Don't let the boss cast buffs!
2000055	This is the 3rd and final pattern. Focus your hits on the Crystal of Protection.
2000056	Hit the Crystal, hit it, hit it!
2000057	Heal! Heal! Heal me, come on!
2000058	Why am I the only one getting hit? Not fair!
2000059	What, a heal? Man, we just can't catch a break today!
2000060	Come on, let's hurry up and finish it off so we can go eat.
2000061	Why is the AI so good? Do they want us to beat this thing or not?
2000062	We will be faithful servants to our new ruler.
2000063	We humbly offer you this Chest of Offerings.
2000064	Shilen's shout: I will take that power off your hands now.
2000065	Punitive creatures, die!
2000066	I'm the new ruler here!
2000067	Only death awaits those who refuse to serve me.
2000068	Will Jermann be restored to what he used to be?
2000069	We must accept that only the mighty can survive! We must obtain power so that we can have our revenge on Shilen!
2000070	Seek the stone statue of Jermann the Great Leader for assistance, and you will be guided to the next step.
2000071	You will need to prepare skills that match your new power.
2000072	Well, I'll continue my story next time we meet. See ya.
2000073	Loyal Captain
2000074	I think this is as far as I can go in helping you, $s1. I will bow out now.
2000075	I want a slushie…oh, if only I could have a slushie…hey, if you bring me 10 of each ingredient, I'll make you a Summer Slushie!
2000076	I'll give you a Boss Accessory Pack if you bring me 15 Summer Slushies!
2000077	Well, howdy-do! Isn't my swimsuit the cutest thing ever? It's time for a tan, yes it is!
2000078	Thanks! I'll be counting on you next time too!
2000079	Oh come on… you have to bring me the right materials!
2000080	Aghh! Zombies! Zombies!
2000081	Ugh…please, someone get rid of these zombies…
2000082	I've been bitten by a zombie…someone help me…
2000083	Is there no hero that can save us?
2000084	Einhasad, dear goddess…please save us…
2000085	We have to protect the Crystal of Protection if we want to stop these blasted zombies.
2000086	Filthy creatures of Shilen… the town will be ruined if we don't stop the zombies.
2000087	I can't partake in the battle because I have to defend the Crystal of Protection. Please, someone stop these zombies.
2000088	Zombies are rising at the outskirts of the Town of Gludio, and coming this way.
2000089	Zombies are rising at the outskirts of the Town of Aden, and coming this way.
2000090	Zombies are rising at the outskirts of the Town of Schuttgart, and coming this way.
2000091	Zombies are rising at the outskirts of Talking Island Village, and coming this way.
2000092	The age of chaos and darkness has come. I shall guide you to darkness.
2000093	I will make you invincible with the power of this plague.
2000094	Humans…so complacent and weak after years of peace. How about I let you spread the fear of pestilence unto them?
2000095	For the prosperity of my people, I will use my power on Jermann and Jermann only.  I cannot overpower my own people.
2000096	Are you ready to face your enemies?
2000097	You sense the presence of Pirate Captain Uthanka at the outskirts of Talking Island Village.
2000098	Dwarven Rescue
2000099	Support the Troops
2000100	Eliminate the Grotesque Giant Bug
2000101	Analyzing the Purple Crevice
2000102	It would be rude to turn down a personal invitation, wouldn't it?
2000103	Ah, someone who recognizes me for the great soul that I am! Haha. Of course I'll come! I have a moral obligation to honor you with my presence.
2000104	Oh, that's right! I should go and see how my money's being spent!
2000105	Um, I can't right now. Sorry. Maybe someone else?
2000106	Oh, you can have this instead. It's a Contender's Mark.
2000107	A festival at Fantasy Isle? Sounds fun! I'll go over and check it out right now.
2000108	Fantasy Isle has a festival, you say? I'd be happy to go!
2000109	Does it have a lot of attractions? No, don't tell me - I'll go see for myself!
2000110	Ooh, sorry, but I've just been. It was a lot of fun!
2000111	The new monster duels were my favorite!

2010005	Hello, good to see you!
2010006	Please pet me.
2010007	Welcome to Ancient City Arcan.
2010008	I am the most handsome cat.
2010009	Today must be a lucky day.
2010010	It smells good.
2010011	Things are strange so I'm cautious.
2010012	You seem nice.
2010013	For Great General Kimerian!
2010014	Glory to Kimerian!
2010015	Eternity to Kimerian!
2010016	Devote Myself for the Glory of Kimerian!

2010025	No regrets until death
2010026	A faint breeze makes me sensitive

2010028	Defeat all of the resistance fighters!
2010029	Hurray Kimerian!
2010030	Great Leader Kimerian!
2010031	Go Advance!

2010035	Ahh...
2010036	We can't stop here...
2010037	Please don't make my death fruitless...
2010038	Now! Before it's too late, we need to track Kimerian to catch him!
2010039	I don't think this is the right way.
2010040	We lost tracking Kimerian. Let's turn to another direction.
2010041	Tracking goes to another direction.
2010042	This seems to be a wrong direction.
2010043	Let's go upward deep inside the forest.
2010044	Tracking goes to the waterfall.
2010045	Let's continue on this road.
2010046	Let's keep going upward a bit more.
2010047	There Kimerian!
2010048	Found Kimerian!
2010049	Rotten Kimerian! This is the fury of Fairies!
2010050	Kimerian is hiding right there!
2010051	We found Kimerian hiding in the cave right there!
2010052	Followers of Kimerian!
2010053	For the Freedom of Fairies!
2010054	Ready!
2010055	Go! Wipe out Kimerian!
2010056	It smells in here.
2010057	Let's go in.
2010058	Let's go in.
2010059	My heart is pounding.
2010060	Until the end! Kimerian!
2010061	Kimerian! This is my revenge for the Fairy victims!
2010062	Kimerian! We are here to punish you!
2010063	This is my revenge for my comrades who were transformed and have disappeared!
2010064	How ridiculous! You think you can find me?
2010065	Then try. Ha ha ha.
2010066	You're still trying?
2010067	Ha ha ha ha...
2010068	Arrogant asses...! I won't forget this...!
2010069	You did it! Thank you!
2010070	Unfortunately, they ran away.
2010071	I'm going to die! Use glimmer on me!
2010072	Use glimmer on me!
2010073	You are a resistance fighter! Please take me with you!
2010074	We can find Sword of Revolution!
2010075	I hope this is helpful.
2010076	We defeated Kimerian!
2010077	We did it!
2010078	Hurray!
2010079	You did it well!
2010080	We defeated a tyrant!
2010081	Wooow!
2010082	Lalala~ Even though the Mother Tree is ill and the town is plagued...
2010083	I am so thankful that Rizraell is staying with me~
2010084	Dark energy is creeping in and Shilen is about to resurrect...
2010085	Let's give warm healings to each other~
2010086	La lalala~
2010087	Resurrect and open your eyes in the dark...
2010088	Then create more offerings of Shilen!
2010089	Kimerian ran away. Let's return to the village and talk.
2010090	You did a lot of work! Let's go back to the village and have a congratulatory drink!
2010091	They are rookie rebellions.
2010092	Resistance underlings!
2010093	Treason is punishable by death.
2010094	Who do you think you are to try my authority!
2010095	Defeat! Kimerian!
2010096	For the Freedom of Fairies!
2010097	Phantom image!
2010098	Umm. You're still alive?
2010099	I won't let you get away any more!
2010100	How dare you came to me! This is where you'll be buried.
2010101	But you came this far, I should at least play with you a little.
2010102	Thanks!
2010103	Now I feel much better.
2010104	Energy is soaring!
2010105	I feel better!
2010106	Thank you for saving me!
2010107	You did it well. Good bye now.
2010108	Protect the spirits of light!
2010109	For peace!
2010110	Dear darkness! Dear goddess!
2010111	Dear the goddess of destruction... The light and their creatures fear you...
2010112	Tainted Dimension

3000000	Heh, I'll tell you about your face. Let me see you better. Raise your head.
3000001	What? This is a face? Amazing. Should I recommend you to a plastic surgeon?
3000002	Hmm... not bad.
3000003	Wow, I've never seen a face like yours! Gorgeous! Your eyes, nose, and lips are the best!
3000004	Let me assess your body! Turn around.
3000005	Argh! What's this? Can't keep my eyes open!
3000006	Well... you are alright. You need to exercise more though.
3000007	Wow! You look very healthy!
3000008	I'll check your luck with money. Let's see what the future has in store for you.
3000009	Well, let's not be friends. You'll be losing a lot of Adena. Don't even ask me to lend you some!
3000010	Your luck with money isn't that bad. That doesn't mean I'll lend you money, though. Hmph.
3000011	Let's be good friends! You'll have plenty of Adena throughout your life!
3000012	Let me check your personality. Let's see how good of a person you are.
3000013	Er. You have no friends, am I right? You have to be nice to get friends!
3000014	At least it looks like people like you.
3000015	Oh wow, are you a reincarnation of Buddha? How about changing your nickname to Dalai Lama?
3000016	You need to be fashionable to be popular. Let me check your fashion sense.
3000017	What?! Hip-hop pants and a loose t-shirt? Red socks?! Ugh!
3000018	You are normal. Try to find something unique though.
3000019	Wow! You dress like a celebrity! Great!
3000020	Let me check your luck with romantic relationships. I want to know!
3000021	How sad. You don't have any luck in this area. Just get a pet if you are lonely.
3000022	You are pretty lucky. You'll live a happy married life.
3000023	Wow! How many people have you met!
3000024	How about doing some business? Want me to check your luck in that area?
3000025	Nope. No. Absolutely no. Don't you even think about doing business.
3000026	Oh, you will be just fine doing business. How about starting a shop in Giran?
3000027	Well, it looks like you'll become the next billionaire. Adena will just keep pouring in!
3000028	What's your IQ? Want me to test you?
3000029	Do you know what the IQ of a whale is? Hmm? Well, your score is lower than that…
3000030	You are average. You'll be just fine getting through life.
3000031	You are like Einstein and Stephen Hawking! How about studying nuclear engineering or physics?
3000032	Are you good with speeches? I'll check how good you are.
3000033	Er. How about taking some speech classes? I'm sure it will come in handy.
3000034	Not bad at all. You can talk your way through anything.
3000035	Why don't you get into politics? You'll be great!
3000036	Humor is vital in this day and age. Let me see how you rank in that aspect.
3000037	Well, you better keep your mouth shut. Don't even try to make a joke.
3000038	Not bad. People love your wit.
3000039	How do you keep up with the latest trends? Amazing! So witty!
3000040	Let's test your stamina.
3000041	Huh. Your body's real age is 70. Try exercising some more. I recommend squats.
3000042	You are overflowing with power. Just right for your age.
3000043	This power...! Your stamina is the best I've seen!
3000044	How about testing your fighting abilities? Equip your items and let's see.
3000045	Can you even defeat one monster? There's something called enchantment, you know?
3000046	You're good enough to be in a party, I guess.
3000047	Your party members must love you! I'm sure you can kill multiple monsters at once!
3000048	It's a dance party! Show me your moves. I'll tell you how good you are.
3000049	Huh? That's dancing? I've never seen anything like that.
3000050	That's right! You got some good moves.
3000051	You are the reincarnation of Michael Jackson! Amazing!
3000052	Food is one of the necessities of life! How are your cooking skills?
3000053	Ugh! Is this edible? Well... thank you for the food, but I'll pass.
3000054	Oh, this is good. Party at your house next week?
3000055	This is the best thing I've ever had! So delicious!
3000056	Are you currently a clan leader or do you dream of becoming one? I'll take a look at your leadership skills.
3000057	Do you have a dog or a cat at home? I'm sure not even they listen to you.
3000058	You should be fine leading a small group of friends.
3000059	No one can say no to you! Great leadership! How about starting a clan?
3000060	Lineage 2 is all about the community. Let's see how sociable you are.
3000061	Do you have anyone on your friends list? You play by yourself, huh?
3000062	You are sociable enough to have quite a few friends.
3000063	Do you have like a thousand friends? You can get close to someone you just met, right?
3000064	How many true friends do you have? The more stars that show up, the greater the number of true friends that you have.
3000065	Aw, you don't have that many friends. Don't worry, I'll be your friend.
3000066	Three true friends! Treat them well. They'll be your friends forever.
3000067	You have a lot of true friends. Can I become one of your true friends as well?
3000068	How good are you at singing? Go ahead, I want to hear you sing.
3000069	Was that you singing? I thought you were just shouting.
3000070	Well, at least you can hit the right notes. Not bad.
3000071	Wow, you are a great singer! I'm sure you are always the life of the party!
3000072	Crafting is the life of Lineage 2. Want me to check your luck with crafting?
3000073	Nope. Don't try crafting. You'll fail every single time.
3000074	At least you'll break even and gain some. How about talking to a maestro in the village?
3000075	You'll make a lot of money with crafting. Try crafting something expensive!
3000076	Weapons that turn blue and red! Want me to check your luck with enchanting today?
3000077	Nope. Don't try enchanting. Just don't.
3000078	You'll have no problems getting to + 6. You shouldn't try to go higher than that, though.
3000079	Eek! If you enchant something right now you'll get it up to + 14! Lady Luck is on your side!
3000080	I'll check how good you were with relationships in your prime years.
3000081	No need to tell me anything. I'm sure you've gone on lonely walks at the park many times. How sad.
3000082	You've had your share of experiences with a significant other, I see.
3000083	How many people have you met!
3000084	Are you nice to your party members? I'll rate how nice you are.
3000085	How could you? You join a party and don't even look at your screen after that, huh?
3000086	Oh, you know how to treat your party members well. I'm sure you're loved by many.
3000087	If everyone could be just like you! You are so nice to everyone!
3000088	I'll check your health. Take a deep breath. Now stick out your tongue.
3000089	Hmm. How old are you? I know a good facility for the elderly. Should I refer you there?
3000090	You are doing well. Remember to get a checkup from time to time, though.
3000091	Great! I'm sure you'll live to be 130 years old!
3000092	I'll check your speed. Try running around.
3000093	Huh? It looks like you'll have to work on your speed.
3000094	You are quick! Not bad.
3000095	Did you just move? I didn't even notice.
3000096	They say that the eyes show your inner state. Let me check your eyes.
3000097	What's up with your eyes? You need more energy.
3000098	Your eyes are so pretty!
3000099	Ah! Please close your eyes. If not, I will fall into them.
3000100	Talk to me now! I'll disappear in 10 seconds.

8888009	Amazing... but this is the end. Full force advance!
8888010	I now have to go and handle it.
8888011	For the eternal rest of the forgotten heroes!
8888012	Their possession can be broken by breaking the sphere of light.
8888013	We need a little more...
8888014	I will summon more spheres of light with the last of my strength.
8888015	A little more... Please try a little more.

10338010	You may use Scroll of Afterlife from Hermuncus to Awaken.
10338011	An intruder… interesting.
10338012	Prove your worth…
10338013	Only those strong enough shall proceed.
10338014	Are you against the will of light?
10338015	Come! Attack me if you dare!
10338016	Are you planning to betray the gods and follow a Giant?
10338017	It's the end for you traitor!
10338018	Haha…
10338019	I want to hear you cry.
10338020	Mortal!

10338022	You will not free Hermuncus. 
10338023	You'll have to kill us first!

10338032	Only those of light may pass. Others must prove their strength.
10338033	Warrior. I've finally got out of seal of light thanks to you.
10338034	Is strength to defend the world what you wanted?
10338035	I will awaken you...
10338036	Receive this power form the ancient Giant. 
10338037	Use this new power when the time is right.
10363001	Resurrected Soul
11021701	We saw people use Sayune other than the Giant's Minions.
11021702	It's because they have become Awaken… the power of the Giant's.
11021703	Duh, you can't use Sayune without powers of Giants in the first place.
11021704	I think that's why many people come to visit Celphine.
11021705	After Ye Sagira fell there were many sacrifices made.
11021706	Didn't that release the seal on Hermuncus?
11021707	That's the rumor, but nothing to confirm it.
11021708	It's got to be true, we need to find it.
