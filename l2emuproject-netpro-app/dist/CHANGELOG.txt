VERSION [1.6]
-------------
Dimensional server support.
LATEST Helios support and packet definitions.
More analytics.
More scripting under a managed environment capabilities.

VERSION [1.5]
-------------
Helios support and packet definitions.

VERSION [1.4]
-------------
Various packet definition updates.
Interpreter data update in response to Underground updates.
Fixed L2 html (chat/community board) handling within webview and copying as text/xml. [Zealar]
Fixed build after updating dependency versions. [rocknowx]
ECJ will now be shipped by default and used when NetPro is run via a JRE, so scripting features can be used.
NetPro will now automatically detect changes to scripts and recompile as necessary.
Changed Windows launcher to be much more compatible, which should work by default even on a x86 client JRE. Unix launcher retains old parameters.

VERSION [1.3]
-------------
Underground support.
Minor definition updates.
Ability to copy (CTRL+C) a packet directly from the packet list in interpreted format (instead of row contents).
Ability to export UI packet list content to text/XML. [rocknowx]
Non-captured packets should be invisible in log files as well. [rocknowx]
XML format now specifies network protocol revision.

VERSION [1.2]
-------------
Minor definition updates.
Support for reading L2PacketHack (l2phx) and packetsamurai packet log files.
Ability to export data contained in NetPro packet logs to various formats ([interpreted] text, l2phx, packetsamurai, etc.)
Offline/non-logged packet content interpretation dialog (any protocol).
AntiTraceRt now functions properly in Valiance and above.

VERSION [1.1]
-------------
New precompiled script cache naming scheme.
Overriding opcode assignments now automatically invalidate inherited assignments.
commons-ui dependency was discontinued and integrated directly into NP.
A lot of definitions moved to previous protocol versions to increase their effective scope; legacy definitions added/updated.
Updated henna related packet definitions for 2015-06-10 protocol version 24 henna stealth patch. See the associated XMLs on how to revert that if using with the installer's version 24 client.

VERSION [1.0]
-------------
Further work on removing duplicate features from dependencies.
Replaced an incompatible DDS reading library with an own-made reader specifically for Lineage II crests (DXT1).
Removed anti-decompilation library integration.

VERSION [0.8-SNAPSHOT] (pre-releases)
----------------------
Further work on internal dependency redimization.
Support for NA infinite odyssey protocol 24.
Fixed an issue where reloading packet definitions would cause the active packet display configuration to be reset, even if it is exactly the same as saved to file.
More interpreters & updated entity name lists.
Reintroduced support for l2j login servers.

Internal refactoring related to de-bloating & opensourcing dependencies.

Fixed issues with CPU hogging while connecting to a server or after failing to connect to a server.

Packet structure handling implementation related changes:
Field value condition/interpreter/modifier implementation moved to netpro-commons. It is a fundamental way to deal with typed fields; not merely restricted to L2 or GUI mode.
As a result, netpro-commons-ui was removed. The implementation was changed to better suit today's use cases.
Added protocol 610 definition.

Support for legacy login ServerList with > 1 gameserver injection. Also, legacy ServerLists are now properly interpreted.
Support for running on a JRE; script.cache is now included in a release by default.
Ability to use a single NP as a hub for proxying multiple login servers.
Ability to advertise both local and internet IPs in ServerList packet.
Packet content interpretation for packets to be injected.
Incremental loading of opcode_mapping.xml files AND a thorough review of their content.
Definitions for packets "actually in use" by prelude beta client & server. Due to incremental loading, this means less XMLs in GF/HF folders (in certain cases, Valiance was also affected).
Few minor fixes in packet definitions applicable to Ertheia.
New example script: examples.game.AntiSpam (filters bot RWT advertisement spam; configurable).
FastLogin support for legacy login servers (except security card).
Network I/O configuration options added & default values optimized.
Configuration option not to open tabs for login connections has been added.

FastLogin now supports PIN-less definitions.
FastLogin now supports Security Card authorization.
Added additional packet log filtering by regex, accessible right within the packet table. [michael1414]
Added the ability to pause/resume packet logging to the packet table. [michael1414]
Added IP aliases to be used within the UI (including free samples :).
Added a bottom information panel.
Changed L&F initialization to respect a manually set L&F system property, as well as to select the native L&F by default (instead of Nimbus). [LoneRanger]

Moved scripts outside the application JAR.
